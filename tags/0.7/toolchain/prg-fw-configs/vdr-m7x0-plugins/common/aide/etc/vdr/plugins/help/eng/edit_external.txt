     The configuration file 'reccmds.conf' can be used to define system commands that can be applied to the recording that is currently highlighted in the "Recordings" menu. The "Red" button in the "Recordings" menu opens the "Recording commands" menu if there are commands defined in the file 'reccmds.conf'. Pressing one of the keys '1'..'9' in the "Recordings" menu executes the corresponding command from 'reccmds.conf' (see also "Executing system commands" below).
