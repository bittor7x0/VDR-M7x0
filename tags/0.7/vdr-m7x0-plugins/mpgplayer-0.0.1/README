See the file COPYING for license information.



Description:

replays MPEG PS stream files

mpeg files have to end with extension .mpg (e.g. movie.mpg)
can replay files larger then 2GB
needs no index file, in fact cannot use it :(
can replay a file while a second program (e.g. VLC) streams into the same file (e.g.for watching DVD's) (you will need a working NFS or samba share for that)
can display an info file (same place and name as mpg file but with extension .txt, e.g. movie.mpg -> movie.txt)



Limitations:

replay always starts at the beginning
at the end of the file the replay restarts from beginning
can only skip forth and back in small or large steps (colored keys)
progress bar available, but no valid time infos yet



TODO (in my personal ranking):

implement resume functionality
stop at the end of file
more/better OSD informations
implement player for MPEG TS streams
delete functionality
???
