Description: OSD Games Collection

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the new vdr OSD games collection formaly known as the tetris plugin.
The collection currently contains Tetris, Tron, TicTacToe, Snake and
Minesweeper, more to come. ;-)

The plugin will be built as a "Stand Alone SDL" program, when it finds
"sdl-config" in your $PATH. Very handy for debugging and testing.

I would like to hear your opinion, feature request or suggestions and also
will be very pleased to receive your patches, betterments or new game
implementations.

Most games are based on simple Open Source versions of their famose originals.
I have rewritten, changed, removed and/or added large parts of the source.
Nevertheless I used code from the following people, so my thanks go to:

Justin Todd     (Snake)
Franko Kulaga   (Tetris)
Rhett D. Jacobs (Tron)
Aaron Rogers    (TicTacToe)
Gerard Monells  (Minesweeper)
