Description:
-----------
Pilotskin is a plugin for VDR based on the plugin vdr-pilot created by Olivier
Jacques. It brings the ability to fastly browse 
the EPG information (Extended Program Guide) without being forced
to switch to a channel.
It makes it easy to see what is going on on other channels while still
looking at the current channel. The browsing calls the
skin that you use, and the plugin has the appearance of the OSD *Display
Channel Info*. The plugin adds the possibility of having detailed
information of the event and launching timers

Installation:
------------
- Type "make plugins" at VDR directory level
- Edit the keymacros.conf 
  cd "VDR_CONFIG_DIR"
  vi keymacros.conf
