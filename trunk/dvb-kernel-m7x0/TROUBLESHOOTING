Troubleshooting - or the most common problems...
------------------------------------------------

If you encounter any troubles building and installing the driver you might
want to check that the following prerequisites are satisfied:

You must have the kernel sources for the kernel you are currently using
installed, and symlinked to /lib/modules/$(KERNEL_VERSION)/build. This should
be the default in proper installations with installed kernel source package.

If you are in doubt please get a fresh and clean kernel source tarball from
http://www.kernel.org/, unpack, configure, install and boot this one before
building the DVB driver. 80% of the bug reports on the linux-dvb mailing list
have been related to not properly installed kernel source trees in the past.

For cards with MPEG decoder onboard make sure that CONFIG_VIDEO_DEV is enabled
in the config of your running kernel. If you get unresolved symbols named
video_XXXX when loading the driver then you missed this option.

For some cards you need Input and Event Device Support enabled to get the
IR receiver on the card running. Be sure to enable CONFIG_INPUT and
CONFIG_INPUT_EVDEV if you get unresolved symbols named input_XXX.

For bttv cards you need a recent bttv driver installed, this is either part
of the kernel or available as standalone driver on Gerd Knorr's website
(http://bytesex.org/). Also you need to explicitly enable i2c and i2c bitbanging
support in your kernel for those cards.

If you get a message 'insmod: no such device' while loading the driver - don't
worry, this is normal, since you load the drivers for all possible cards some
of the drivers complain because they don't find a matching card in your system.
You can safely remove those ones from the list in the insmod scripts.

If you are sure that all the issues above don't cause your problems you might
want to ask on the linux-dvb mailing list for further assistance
(http://www.linuxtv.org/mailinglists/).

good luck,

Holger
