Changes for linuxtv-dvb-1.1.1:
o fixed various timing issues in frontend code to speed up tuning
o fixed pointer bug in ring buffer handling which potentially
  affected common interface communication
o fixed av7110 debi functions for ARM64, added better error checking
o fixed software demux section filter bug which caused data loss
  if there were two sections in one TS packet and the first section
  was smaller than 18 bytes
o frontend fixes for ves1820 and stv0299
o added support for Fujitsu-Siemens Activy card 
o various minor cleanup things


Changes for linuxtv-dvb-1.1.0:

  Too many to list them all ;-)
  The most important things:

o This release is from a different CVS tree (dvb-kernel), which is
  structured like the Linux kernel source tree.
o test/demo applications and utilies are unbundled and released
  seperately
o support for Linux 2.6.x; in fact, this release is a snapshot of
  the stuff which is part of the 2.6.x kernel
o added support for bt8xx based DVB cards and various USB things
o completely new saa7146 driver, which is shared among DVB and
  some analog TV cards
o firmware binaries are not part of the release because of licensing
  problems; see the README for information where to get


============================================================================

Changes for linuxtv-dvb-1.0.1:
o DMA fix by Jon Burgess
o fixed PCI latency setting in SAA7146 driver
o added module parameter 'latency' to dvb-ttpci (saa7146_core.c).  Default value is 0 -> latency settings are *not* modified.
o fixes frontend drivers
o allow readonly-open of video device
o many improvements and bugfixes in scan utility
o new keymaps for av7110_loadkeys utility
o improvements in test_stillpicture demo


Changes for linuxtv-dvb-1.0.0:
o added backport of Technisat Skystar2 (B2C2 FlexCopII) driver from dvb-kernel
o new frontends: tda1004x, mt312
o various frontend fixes for grundig_29504-401, grundig_29504-491, ves1820, alps_tdlb7,
  stv0299
o subtle changes to core frontend code to improve tuning
o dvb_net stability fixes
o AV7110 driver fixes: OSD memory handling; v4l overlay window fixes for Zapping
  (http://zapping.sourceforge.net/); SW section filter fix (stale data);
  MAC handling for dvb_net; link-level CI fixes (for VDR); fix DMX_GET_STC to
  get the msb right; I2C bus speedup; fix grabbing in VIDEO_PALETTE_UYVY mode;
  added module parameter 'latency' to change PCI latency; added IR remote
  control keymaps for Medion MD 4688 (medion_088.rc5 is for address 0,
  medion_155.rc5 for address 2)
o many fixes and extenstions to apps/scan, including correct output in VDR format
o revise "make install" for drivers using DVB_MOD_SUBDIR / DVB_MOD_DIR / DESTDIR


Changes for linuxtv-dvb-1.0.0-pre3:
o scan: considerable rewrite of section I/O using poll() instead of busy waiting
o scan: reports PCR PID and service type (01: TV, 02: radio, >=03: other)
  in "pids" output format
o ves1820 patch by <jaakko@hyvatti.iki.fi> to distinguish different 
  PLL/Synthesizer combinations used by Siemens and Technotrend on their 
  DVB-C cards
o scan: attempt to parse the freqeuency-list descriptor for DVB-T (untested),
  set INVERSION_AUTO for tuning (was 0 == INVERSION_OFF before),
  patch from Franck Arnaud (with modifications) to restore scan output
  to be usable by szap
o av7110: Sharing SDRAM between TT re-insertion and OSD to have more 
  video buffer; firmware version 0x2615
o dvb-core: fixed a deadlock in dvb_frontend.c
o av7110_loadkeys: keymap for universal remote controls by PHILIPS, BAUR, 
  INTERFUNK, MARANTZ, NECKERMANN, OTTO VERSAND, QUELLE, THORN, LIESENKOTTER, 
  contributed by Poul Py
o API change: added VIDEO_EVENT_SIZE_CHANGED and VIDEO_GET_SIZE ioctl
  (both implemented for AV7110 based PCI cards)
o API change: added SEC_VOLTAGE_OFF to turn off satellite frontend power
  (implemented for alps_bsrv2 and stv0299 frontend drivers)
o various improvements to frontend drivers and frontend-thread handling
  (ves1820, grundig_29504-401, alps_tdlb7, stv0299)
o disabled frontend zig-zap scan for DVB-C (improved tuning behaviour)
o fixes and extensions for the "scan" program, including VDR output format
o fixed A/V sync bug with link-layer-CI firmware (always set PCR PID)
o fixes for IR remote control handling (key repeat, device addressing)
o added DMX_GET_STC ioctl
o added software section filter capability to av7110 driver
  (module parameter "hw_sections")
o correct ADAC volume settings (av7110 driver)
o msp3400 volume control fixes for Siemens DVB-C cards
o ...and some things we don't remember. Check the CVS changelogs for
  details, cvsps is your friend... 


Changes for linuxtv-dvb-1.0.0-pre2:
o AV7110 firmware update; fixes OSD problems with VDR
o fixes to poll() handling for audio and video device
o stop video DMA (overlay) when v4l device is closed
o fixes to ring buffer handling for CI link layer interface
o added PCI ids for "Technotrend/Hauppauge Nexus PCI DVB-S"


Changes for linuxtv-dvb-1.0.0-pre1 from siemens_dvb-0.9.4:
o overhauled Linux DVB API, especially for the frontends
o new device naming scheme
o unfortunately too many to list them all...
