linuxtv-dvb-1.1.1
=================

Digital Video Broadcast drivers for Linux 2.4.19+ and Linux 2.6.x.

Note: Unlike in previous releases, the test/utility programs have
been unbundled and are released seperately as linuxtv-dvb-apps-1.1.0.


Linux 2.6.x:
  The DVB drivers are already included in Linux 2.6.x, so you usually
  don't need this package. What you will need, hwoever, is firmware.
  see below.

Linux 2.4.19+:
  Due to changes in the video4linux layer we don't support kernels
  older than 2.4.19. If you need to use an older kernel you must
  apply video4linux patches to the kernel first.


Quick start:
------------

1. Get firmware:

  Some DVB cards need firmware to operate. Due to licensing problems
  we won't distribute the firmware binaries with the driver source,
  you must get them seperately. See below for details about where
  to get and where to put.

  For Linux 2.6.x also see linux/Documentation/dvb/firmware.txt and
  linux/Documentation/firmware_class/README.

  Note: The firmware loader has been backported from 2.6 to 2.4.24,
  but the drivers do not yet support this. You must compile the
  firmwares into the drivers.


2. cd build-2.4 or build-2.6

3. make

4. ./insmod.sh load

  Note: Some of the drivers will refuse to load and spit out
  error messages if they cannot find their hardware. You can
  ignore them, or edit insmod.sh and comment out drivers that
  you don't need.

  You will have to load at least two drivers:
  - one for the main DVB card / device
  - one for the frontend (i.e. tuner + demodulator)


Detailed instructions for building:
-----------------------------------

If you encounter any problems while executing the follwing steps please read
the TROUBLESHOOTING file.

Simply type 'make' to build the driver. The compiled modules will be located
in directory ./build-2.4/ or ./build-2.6/, depening on the kernel version you
are running. There you will also find scripts to load and unload the modules.

For some cards or frontends you need to download additional firmware
binaries:

- dvb-ttpci: http://www.linuxtv.org/download/dvb/
  => wget http://www.linuxtv.org/download/dvb/dvb-ttpci-01.fw
  Place the "dvb-ttpci-01.fw" file in the build-2.4 and/or build-2.6
  directory. The firmware will be compiled into the driver at it used to
  be.

- alps_tdlb7: 
  This driver needs a copy of the firmware file 'Sc_main.mc' from the
  Haupauge windows driver in the '/usr/lib/hotplug/firmware' directory.
  Alternatively, you can also pass the complete filename with the module
  parameter 'firmware_file'.

- tda1004x:
  This driver needs a copy of the DLL "ttlcdacc.dll" from the Haupauge or
  Technotrend windows driver saved as
  '/usr/lib/hotplug/firmware/tda1004x.bin'. You can also pass the complete
  file name with the module parameter 'tda1004x_firmware'.
  Currently the DLL from v2.15a, or 2.16a of the technotrend PCI driver is supported.
  Please note, even if you're using a USB device, you _must_ get the
  file from the TechnoTrend PCI driver.
  Windows driver URL: http://www.technotrend.de/

- ttusb-dec:
  see "ttusb-dec.txt" in linux/Documentation for details

If something is missing, you get notified in the build process or when
loading the modules.

Just in case you are wondering: the "alps_bsrv2" driver is gone, please use
the new "ves1x93" driver instead.

In ./build-2.4/ or ./build-2.6/ you find the insmod script.

Use './insmod.sh load' to load the driver modules, './insmod.sh unload' to 
remove them. './insmod debug' loads the drivers with debugging enabled. 
These scripts load all drivers for all cards but the ones based on the bt8xx.
For bt8xx based cards please use the insmod-bt8xx.sh script instead.

Now check the klog and syslog (in doubt type 'dmesg') for error messages.

When you reached this point successfully you probably want to start some
test applications, download the linuxtv-dvb-apps-1.1.tar.gz package, unpack
it and compile it. This package contains some tools to test and debug the
driver:

linuxtv-dvb-apps-1.1/apps/szap/ contains three simple applications called 
szap, czap and tzap for zapping with DVB-S, DVB-C or DVB-T cards.
Read linuxtv-dvb-apps-1.1/apps/szap/ README for usage instructions.

Note 1: tuning succeeded if you see the FE_HAS_LOCK flag and "status 1f"; a
good signal has a low bit error rate (ber) and zero uncorrectable packets (unc).

Note 2: you must keep ?zap running, or the frontend will go to sleep (unless
you load dvb-core.o with dvb_shutdown_timeout=0)

If your card has a hardware MPEG decoder you can watch TV with xawtv (together
with e.g. szap for DVB tuning); Note: xawtv cannot control the DVB tuner, you
must use ?zap

For cards without hardware MPEG decoder you need a software MPEG decoder, 
e.g. mplayer or xine (you need *very* recent versions which understand MPEG2 
transport streams; xine v0.9.21 and mplayer dev-CVS-030723-16:39-3.3.1 seem to 
work); Note: You must run ?zap with the -r flag to enable stream output to the 
dvr device, and keep it running while watching tv.  

Examples: 
	mplayer - < /dev/dvb/adapter0/dvr0 
	xine stdin://mpeg2 < /dev/dvb/adapter0/dvr0
	
Note: Newest mplayer and xine versions are reported to have builtin DVB support
(see ./linux/Documentation/dvb/faq.txt for more info).

For 'real' everyday use you probably don't want to use these test applications 
but install a program like VDR or MythTV.
(Read ./linux/Documentation/dvb/faq.txt for some links)

When everything is working you probably want to install the driver on your 
system by typing 'make install'. If you want to load the modules automatically
when an application tries to open the device you need to add lines like these 
to your modules.conf:

	probeall /dev/dvb dvb-ttpci
	alias /dev/dvb/* /dev/dvb
	below dvb-ttpci alps_bsrv2 alps_tdmb7 alps_tdlb7
	add below dvb-ttpci grundig_29504-401 grundig_29504-491
	add below dvb-ttpci stv0299 ves1820

Note: this example is for people with Technotrend-based PCI cards, they must 
load the dvb-ttpci driver and a matching frontend drivers that are potentially
used on these cards. In order to find out which ones are required for your
setup check the lsmod output after loading the driver like described above.
Those DVB modules that have a usecount greater zero are required in your 
setup - edit the modules.conf file appropriatly]

Debian users don't edit modules.conf manually but add the lines above to a new
file in /etc/modutils/ (e.g. /etc/modutils/dvb) and call 'update-modules' then.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The build system has been tested down to 2.4.20, if you run an older kernel
either update your kernel or just try - maybe you need to add some tweaks in
the dvb_compat.[hc] files. Please report your modifications on the linux-dvb 
mailing list.

If you want to build a not-standalone driver but want to patch your 2.6 kernel
source tree with this driver please read README-2.6.

More documentation is located in ./linux/Documentation/dvb/.

good luck,

Holger
