See the file COPYING for license information.


Description (version 0.4.0):

This simple plugin displays the status of all
available dvb devices. This could in case of driver
problems. It should works with vdr 1.6.x and maybe 1.7.x,
but not with 1.5.x or earlier. 

For every dvb device known to vdr it shows
* its type (DVB-T, DVB-C (not tested), DVB-S)
* its name 
* its /dev path (/dev/dvb/adapter*)
* its current recordings with their start time and title. 
  Selecting a recording and pressing 'ok' starts it for
  timeshift viewing.
  
  Press the red key to toggle the recordings display. 
  
* the channels the device is currently tuned to.  
  The provider of every channel is also shown. 
  
  The live channel is marked with a plus sign. 
  Crypted channels are marked with a "x".
  There are also marks for radio channels ("r"), tv channels ("t"), 
  video only channels ("v") and payload free channels("?").
  
  The channels are selectable; pressing OK switches to this channel 
  (without exiting the plugin). Pressing the keys "7" or "9"
  will change to the closest transponder with lower or higher frequency.
  Attention: This will break a current recordind on this device!
  
  Press the yellow key to show/hide this channel display. 
  
* the signal strength and the signal / noise ratio of
  the device. Note: Some dvb device driver do not provide this info.
  
  Press the green key to toggle the signal display. 
  Press the blue key to refresh the screen (and thus the values)
  
* The device which delivers the live view is marked with the text "live" 
* the settings are retained between sessions
* there is also a small setup page
  

This plugin is heavily based on the recstatus plugin by 
Christian Wieninger and Mike Constabel 
(<http://www.constabel.net/vdr/plugins.de.htm>). 
To cry it out loudly: devstatus is a renamed version with
additional code. I changed the name to "devstatus" 
because most information this plugin provides 
aren't connected to recordings anymore.

Joe_D at vdr-portal.de implemented the automatic repaint of the screen
as soon as channel are switched or recording starts or stops.
Thanks.


I used also some code from the femon plugin 
(http://www.saunalahti.fi/~rahrenbe/vdr/femon/).
