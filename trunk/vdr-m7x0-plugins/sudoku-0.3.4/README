Requirements:
-------------

- VDR >= 1.3.47


Description:
------------

'Sudoku' is a VDR plug-in to generate and solve Number Place puzzles, so called
Sudokus.

A Sudoku puzzle consists of 9 x 9 cells subdivided into 9 regions with 3 x 3
cells. The rules are simple. There have to be the numbers from 1 to 9 in every
row, column and region. In the beginning some numbers are given. These cells are
painted with cyan background color. The aim of the puzzle is to find the missing
numbers. There is only one solution of a Sudoku puzzle.

The Sudoku puzzles are generated on-the-fly. The number of givens can be set in
the plug-in's setup page down to a minimum of 26 givens. The generation of
puzzles with less than 26 givens takes too long. By default the cells with
givens are symmetrically ordered. But this can be disabled in the setup.

To solve difficult Sudoku puzzles some hints can be used. Incorrect cells are
red and cells with ambiguous numbers are magenta. These hints can be disabled in
the setup. For further hints see the commands menu, which is opened with the
blue key.

Each time the plug-in is started from the main menu the same puzzle is shown. A
new puzzle is only generated on VDR startup or if it has been requested by
selecting this command in the commands menu.

In the commands menu you can load and save puzzles from/to the sudoku-list file.
This file is located at the plugins folder inside the configuration folder of
VDR. If you don't specify a configuration folder, your videodir is used (e.g.
/video0/plugins/sudoku/sudoku-list).

The sudoku-list file contains lines with a sudoku dump and an optional
description. The sudoku dump has to begin at the first position of the line.
The delimiter between sudoku dump and description is a space. All behind the
first space is considered as description.

A sudoku dump consists of up to three parts. The first part contains only the
givens, the second part all numbers set so far (including the givens), and the
third part the marked cells. They are delimited from each other by a colon. All
except of the first part is optional. The parts are strings with 81 digits or
underlines. An underline is considered as a zero. All other characters, except
of colons and spaces, which terminate the string, are ignored. They could be
used to structure the dump, e.g. plus signs after each 9 digits/underlines.
