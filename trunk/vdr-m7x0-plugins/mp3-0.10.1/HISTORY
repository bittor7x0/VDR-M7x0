----------------------------------------------------------------------

21.09.2006: Version 0.9.15 development (vdr 1.4.1-4)
- NOTE: This version has been tested with VDR 1.4.x only. It might be still
  compatible with VDR 1.2.x or 1.3.x, but this wasn't verified.
- In MPlayer filebrowser you can display a summary text file with key "0".
  Filename convention: video filename extended with ".summary", e.g.
  "somefile.avi" -> "somefile.avi.summary". Summary files are not shown in the
  browsers filelist. (was in 0.9.14 already, but was missing in history)
- Using ".txt" and ".nfo" as alternative extention for MPlayer summary file
  display. Suggested by Soeren Sonnenburg.
- Additionaly searching for a MPlayer summary file with the video filename
  extention stripped of (e.g. "somefile.summary").
- Added SVDR and service support to MP3 and MPlayer plugin. Based on a patches
  provided by Olivier Jacques and Holger Brunn.
- Added setup option to reverse title/artist display in MP3 plugin.
- Added support for basic HTTP authorization in MP3 streaming.
- Now passing correct name & path to VDR's status class during MPlayer playback.
- Added commandline option to specify a subdirectory to load sources file from.
  Suggested by Ronny Kornexl.
- Added commandline option to specify a directory for the global MPlayer resume
  file. Suggested by Ronny Kornexl.
- Added -S option to ppmtoy4m call in example image convert script. Suggested by
  Thorsten Gehrig.
- Replaced leftover usleep() calls. Thanks to Malte Schröder.
- Moved cleanup of ID3 cache to a seperate thread to prevent watchdog timeout.
  Suggested by Peter Holik.
- Fixed browser excludes taking effect only after the first directory change.
  Reported by Soeren Sonnenburg.
- Fixed parsing the filename from MPlayer output. Based on a fix from TomG.
- Fixed MPlayer volume changes. Take non-linear changes in VDR into account.
  Reported by Daniel Karsubka.
- Fixed delay when MPlayer process exits at EOF. Reported by Daniel Karsubka.
- Fixed MPlayer volumen handling for VDR 1.4.1-2. Note that the current code
  doesn't work with VDR 1.4.1 and 1.4.1-1.
- Fixed button translations with vdr 1.3.38+. Thanks to Ville Skyttä.

- Removed explizit libz dependency from Makefile. Suggested by Ville Skyttä.
- Updated Makefile according to changes in VDR 1.3.47 & 1.4.1.
- Updated finish translations. Provided by Rolf Ahrenberg.

08.01.2006: Version 0.9.14 development (vdr 1.2.6/1.3.38)
- Fixed VDR hanging for some seconds when skipping songs and fixed pause mode 
  freezing live background when using OSS output. Reported by Andy Grobb.
- Now muting DVB audio while using OSS output.
- Finaly restored the function of the back key (jumps directly to plugin main
  menu) (vdr >= 1.3.32 only). Thanks to Sascha Volkenandt for the hint.
- During MPlayer playback, the name of the current videofile is now parsed from
  the MPlayer output. If you're using some kind of playlist hack, the MPlayer
  plugin will now report the correct filename. Based on suggestions from Ronny
  Kornexl.
- Extended the example mplayer.sh file to show how a playlist can be passed to
  MPLayer.
- Fixed segfault in progress display with skincurses. Thanks to Pasi Juppo for
  reporting.
- Adapted to the API changes in vdr 1.3.38.

31.07.2005: Version 0.9.13 development (vdr 1.2.6/1.3.24)
- Moved OSD position selection to plugin setup menu (as before this works for
  non-skined vdr <1.3.7 only).
- Removed DVD navigation from MPlayer slavemode.
- Added support for configurable keys (0-9) in MPlayer slavemode. The slave
  command can be entered in the plugin setup menu and is sent to MPlayer during
  playback if the key is pressed.
- Added support to display a summary file (plain ascii) in the MPlayer browser.
  If you are on a video file, press '0' to display the summary. The summary file
  has to be named like the video file but with ".summary" appended (e.g.
  video.mpeg -> video.mpeg.summary).
- New MP3 plugin setup option to keep the selection menu opened after selection.
  Suggested by Mikko Mäkinen.
- Fixed ringbuffer timeouts in network code.
- Fixed ID3 V2 tag handling. Unusual big tags caused the ID3 scanner to mark the
  file as bad. Now correctly skipping ID3 tags during playback too. Reported by
  Olaf Henkel.
- Prevent writing to a broken pipe in mplayer slave control. Reported by Gerhard
  Steiner.
- Fixed passing AID 0 to mplayer.sh. To allow MPlayer autoselect the audio
  stream, set AID to -1 (this can only be achieved by entering 0 and than
  pressing left).
- Improved creation of LPCM frames. Based on the changes in muggle 0.1.8.
- Updated french translations. Provided by Jerome Rousset.

17.03.2005: Version 0.9.12 development (vdr 1.2.6/1.3.22)
- Fixed background image convert hanging a long time and some other oddities.
- Now filtering image files in the song browser display.

- Fixed MPlayer slavemode progress display reappearing on user requested close.
- Now explicitly setting C locale in example image convert script. Thanks to
  Tobias Grimm.
- Changed the location where cStatus::MsgReplaying is called. Helps to prevent a
  crash in graphlcd. In my opinion cControl API should be called from the
  foreground thread only. Reported by Wolfgang Fritz.
- Fixed a huge bunch of typos in the documentation. Thanks to Ville Skyttä.
- Updated finish translations. Provided by Rolf Ahrenberg & Ville Skyttä.

20.02.2005: Version 0.9.11 development (vdr 1.2.6/1.3.21)
- Now using propper readdir() to scan directory contents rather than the
  external find & sort tools.
- Added cover image display during MP3 replay. See the README on how this has
  to be configured. If you was using the old image patch, be aware that there
  are now new commandline options and that the layout of the cache directory
  has changed. Initial patch made by Eloy, currently maintained by Tobias Grimm
  for ctvdr-debian package.

06.02.2005: Version 0.9.10 development (vdr 1.2.6/1.3.20)

  the great valgrind tool.
- Fixed some mismatched new[]/delete calls.
- Reduced MP3 decoder memory footprint (stopped state, from 22k to 308).
- Fixed crashes on status display from background threads (e.g. connect to
  streamserver). An asyncronous status display was added.
- Updated finnish translations. Provided by Rolf Ahrenberg.
- Updated recommended library versions to libmad/libid3tag 0.15.1b and
  libsndfile 1.0.11.
- Updated patch for cdfs 0.5c. Correct tracksize for last audio track if a data
  track follows. Thanks to Merten Falk.

10.01.2005: Version 0.9.9 development (vdr 1.2.6/1.3.18)
- Added global MPlayer resume file. This is used if the directory of the video
  file is not writeable. The global resume file is located in the video
  directory.
- Added DVD navigation to MPlayer slavemode. Due to this some other functions
  have been moved to new keys. See MANUAL file.
- Added some glue for vdr 1.3.18.
- Fixed saving of MPlayer setup option "ResumeMode". You can select if you want
  "local/global" or "global only" resume files too.
- Fixed thread deadlock in playmanager and non-blocking libsndfile reader
  (appearently only with some pthread versions) and high cpu usage of
  background scan thread when using libsndfile decoder. Thanks to Tobias Grimm
  for debugging.
- Removed workarounds for broken PCM handling in firmware (PCM pause &
  samplerate changes). This requires DVB firmware 261d-rc6 or newer. If you
  prefer to use an older firmware, you can use the make commandline option
  BROKEN_PCM=1 to enable old behaviour.
- Fixed handling of sym-links in source base path and playlists.
- Fixed path generation for "wide" sym-links.
- Replaced non-reentrant glibc functions with reentrant versions.
- Updated finnish translations. Provided by Rolf Ahrenberg.

28.11.2004: Version 0.9.8 development (vdr 1.2.6/1.3.14)
- Added MPlayer audiostream selection. Audiostream is selected with the blue
  key in the MPlayer menu. The selected stream is passed to the mplayer.sh
  script as "AID x" where x is the stream number. For compatibility reasons the
  AID parameter is passed after the SLAVE parameter. Due to this, parameter
  positions aren't fixed any more. You have to implement a flexible parameter
  parsing in mplayer.sh. See the example file how this can be done. Based on a
  patch from VDR-Portal.
- Fixed segfault in shuffle code when adding a single song to the current
  playlist. Reported by Malte Schröder.
- Fixed segfault in network code (pthread_cancel). Reported by Malte Schröder.
- Fixed mounting/unmounting sources in MPlayer plugin. Reported by Guy Roussin.
- Fixed status display with open (classic) progress display for vdr 1.3.7+.
- Added russian translations (vdr >= 1.3.2). Provided by Vyacheslav Dikonov.

24.09.2004: Version 0.9.7 development (vdr 1.2.6/1.3.12)
- Added non-blocking reader thread to libsndfile decoder.
- Fixed backward skip and progress display. Reported by Burkhardt Petermann.
- Fixed some locking problems in play manager.
- Fixed handling of samplerate changes for DVB & OSS output.

13.09.2004: Version 0.9.6 development (vdr 1.2.6/1.3.12)
- Changed the way how the player maintains the ringbuffer to prevent audio
  dropouts while background scan is active.
- Increased player ringbuffer size and take care of ringbuffer contents when
  skipping forward.
- Prevent full file scan on MP3 decoder check.
- Flushing playlist on playback abort to unblock removable sources. This also
  prevents the background scanner to continue after playback was aborted.
- Removed a buffer-to-buffer copy in DVB output.
- Fixed several race conditions where the play manager could discard the
  currently played or scanned song.
- Added a patch for cdfs 0.5c to correct discid calculation (applies to cdfs
  2.4.20 as well).

07.09.2004: Version 0.9.5 development (vdr 1.2.6/1.3.12)
- Resolved several oddities in progress display if the player is idle.
- Now removing trailing '/' from source definitions in *sources.conf and warn
  the user about this.
- Outdated entries in the MPlayer resume file are removed now.
- Fixed playback start delay in case the background scanner is working on the
  current song.
- Fixed progress display for net streams. Reported by Wolfgang Fritz.
- Fixed MPlayer rewind button (broken by sources fix in 0.9.4). Reported by
  Sebastian Kemper.
- Updated finnish translations. Provided by Rolf Ahrenberg.
- Added a patch that prevents the VDR core from aborting the MP3 player in
  black background mode (see patches subdirectory).

03.09.2004: Version 0.9.4 development (vdr 1.2.6/1.3.12)
- Added a queue manager. During playback you can add new songs to the playlist
  by selecting them from the MP3 menu/browser. To flush the playlist you have
  to stop the player for now. You can add new songs even if the player is kept
  idle (see below).
- Replaced setup option "mute at end of list" with "abort player at end of
  list". If you set this option to "no" and the end of playlist is reached, the
  player is kept idle. To restart playback select a song to restart from there
  or "up" to restart from the begining.
- Background scan (formerly known as ID3 prescan) now also can determine the
  song level. Note that level scan requires to decode the complete song. This is
  done on a seperate thread with nice 5 but nevertheless it needs CPU cycles. If
  your system crawls, you can set background scan to "ID3 only" in the plugin
  setup menu.
- Added commanline option -C to specify the directory to place the id3cache
  file. The default is to place the file into the video directory.
- MPlayer resume feature can now be disabled in the plugin setup menu. No resume
  file is created in this case.
- Another fix to the OSS output. Now using little-endian samples only (which
  should be supported by all soundcard drivers).
- Fixed mounting/unmounting of MPlayer sources (Bug introduced in 0.9.2). Thanks
  to Bill Blough for spotting this one.
- Updated finnish translations. Provided by Rolf Ahrenberg.

03.07.2004: Version 0.9.3 development (vdr 1.2.6/1.3.11)
- If a (single) selected file in the MP3 browser is actualy a playlist (*.m3u),
  load the playlist rather than trying to play the file. This allows to have
  playlists in subdirectories (by now only selectable from the browser not from
  the main menu). Note that song paths must be either absolute or relative to
  the location of the playlist file. Suggested by Helmut Auer.
- Now returning replay mode information in MP3 replay. Suggested by Sascha
  Volkenandt.
- Now paying attention to values returned by OSS ioctl's. This fixes playback
  for sound drivers which doesn't support big-endian samples. Thanks to
  Antti-Pekka Liedes for reporting and testing the fix.
- Added setup option to hide the mainmenu entry.
- Updated finnish translations. Provided by Rolf Ahrenberg.
- Fixed VDR 1.2.x compile issues.
- Fixed crash on status message display while the classic replay display is
  open.

24.06.2004: Version 0.9.2 development (vdr 1.2.6/1.3.11)
- Added a setup option to toggle MP3 replay display between classic and skin
  version. Note that the big playlist display isn't available in skin mode.
- Added rewind button to MPlayer menu. Suggested by Sebastian Kemper.
- Updated finnish translations. Provided by Rolf Ahrenberg.
- Fixed current play time calculation for MPlayer without slave-patch.
  Reported by Uwe Scheffler.
- Fixed status messages which were displayed for ever. Reported by Sascha
  Volkenandt.

- Adapted to the changes in VDR 1.3.7+. Based on patches provided by Sascha
  Volkenandt & Sven Goethel.
- Fixed long standing bug in ID3 tag parsing, when the file contains an
  incomplete ID3 tag at the end of file. Thanks to Matt Tovey for debugging.
- Better german translations. Suggested by Andreas Brachold.
- Now ignoring dot-files in file browser. Suggested by Patrick Cernko.
- Now showing total play time in MPlayer progress display. The value may be
  inaccurate. Suggested by Patrick Cernko.
- Added resume capability for MPlayer. The resume position is stored in a file
  called ".mplayer.resume" in the directory of the MPlayer file. Based on a
  patch provided by Patrick Cernko.
- Added a setup option to mute audio at end of playlist. Based on a patch
  provided by Christoph Gohle.
- Now accepting absolute paths in playlists, even though the path must point to
  somewhere inside the defined source directory. Suggested by Niklaus Stutz.

08.05.2004: Version 0.9.0 development (vdr 1.2.6/1.3.1)
- Added OSS soundcard output. Use make option WITH_OSS_OUTPUT=1 to compile
  support, commandline option -D to change DSP device and plugin setup menu to
  select output mode. Thanks to Gunnar Roth.
- Added shoutcast/icecast metadata parsing. Thanks to Andreas Brachold.
- Now restoring locale settings in MPlayer plugin.
- Fixed MPlayer exit problem while paused.

  locale.
- Fixed jump to minute in MPlayer slavemode.
- If you have installed the "replay mode beauty patch" the new symbols are used
  for MPlayer progressbar too. This feature is auto-detected in the Makefile.

01.09.2002: Version 0.7.4 plugin development (vdr 1.1.8)
- Changed the status string to show the loop/shuffle state too.
- Fixed replay problem with background mode "black". With vdr 1.1.8 you must
  apply the included patch to the base source.

  the full path to the script if the script is in the current PATH.
- Added MANUAL a file.
- New setup option SlaveMode for MPlayer. With SlaveMode enabled you can
  control MPlayer via VDR. A progress display is available too. See MANUAL for
  details (thanks to Dariush Forouher).

23.08.2002: Version 0.7.3 plugin development (vdr 1.1.7)

  compile with version 0.0.x.
- Fixed detection if MPlayer is still running.
- Fixed GetIndex() to return frames rather than seconds (thanks to Martin
  Hammerschmidt).
- The last second of the last song in a playlist wasn't played. Now waiting
  until the ringbuffer is really empty.

16.08.2002: Version 0.7.2 plugin development (vdr 1.1.7)
