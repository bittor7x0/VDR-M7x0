Description:

Osd-Teletext displays the teletext directly on the OSD.
Both sound and video are played in the background. 


Keys:
     1,...,9: insert page number
     Up:      page+
     Down:    page-
     Right:   sub page+
     Left:    sub page-
     Back:    close teletext plugin
     
   All other user interaction ("Actions") is configurably assigned to the other
   available keys.
   You can e.g. configure that you jump to page 100 when you press Red.
   In this example, the Action "Jump to 100" is assigned to key "Red".
   Have a look at the plugin's setup page to learn the current assignment
   and adapt it to your needs.
   
   Available Keys: Blue, Red, Yellow, Green, Play, Stop, FastFwd, FastRwd
   Actions: "Zoom", "Half page", "Switch channel", "Switch background",
            "Jump to..." a specific page.
            
   Description of the actions:
     Zoom:          Zoom to upper half/lower half/back to full page
     Half Page:     Reduce OSD window to the lower half of the screen and display upper half/lower half/back to full size
     Switch channel:Show pages of a channel different from the one currently tuned to.
                    This does _not_ include any tuning or channel switching with vdr's core. 
                    You must have tuned to the channel chosen some time before so that the pages have been stored on disk.
                    When you press the key associated with that action, you are asked for the channel number.
                    Press OK after you entered it with the number keys.
     Jump to...:    Jumps to the page you configure.
     Switch background: Changes the in the setup configurable background color immediately
                        to black and back to your degree of transparency.
                        
   How to configure the key bindings:
   In the plugins setup menu, you can assign one of actions to each key.
   You can choose freely which actions you need, you are not forced to assign
   an action to a key at all if you do not need it.
   If you select "Jump to...", specify the page number in the line immediately below.
   
   
Other Setup options:
   Background transparency: 
               number between 0 (transparent) and 255 (black). Default is 127 (also used by VDR)
   Show Clock: Toggles whether an additional clock is drawn approximately every second.
               The clock shows the current system time, not any time broadcast via teletext.
               Let VDR set the system time from a transponder to have the exact time.
   Auto-update pages: 
               Continuously checks whether a page has changed and updates it if yes.
   OSD width, OSD height: 
               Adjusts the width and height of the OSD independent from VDR's settings.
               The valid range is 40 to 56 for the width and 12 to 21 for the height.
   Minimum user inactivity: 
               Sets a timeout (in minutes) for user inactivity. When this timespan has elapsed
               and the user did not press any keys, the plugin will be closed. Set to 0 to disable this.
               Note that disabling timeout will also effectively disable VDR's auto-shutdown feature
               as long as the plugin is active.
   Key bindings:      See above.
   
Command line options:
   A few settings are given on the command line rather than in the setup menu.
   Available options:
   
     -d        --directory=DIR    The directory where the temporary
                                  files will be stored.
                                  (standard value: /tmp/vtx)
                                  Ensure that the directory exists and is writable.
     -n        --max-cache=NUM    Maximum size in megabytes of cache used
                                  to store the pages on the harddisk.
                                  (standard value: 10 MB)
     -s        --cache-system=SYS Set the cache system to be used.
                                  Choose "legacy" for the traditional
                                  one-file-per-page system.
                                  Default is "packed" for the 
                                  one-file-for-a-few-pages system.

Colors:
  On all sorts of output devices which are not limited as to color depth
  the original teletext colors will be displayed. (Only difference: Cyan is used instead of 
  white to make reading easier).
  On the classic full-featured DVB card and other limited devices, the colors will be reduced to four.
  The mapping is currently optimized for German ARD, ZDF and RTL. If you are for some reason
  really and definitely not satisfied with my choices, edit colormapping.h and recompile.
