- use signaling instead of sleeps when writing to ringbuffers
- optimized cStreamdevPatFilter PAT packet initialization
- fixed cStreamdevPatFilter not processing PATs with length > TS_SIZE - 5

  cStreamdevStreamers SendBuffer as two threads mustn't write to the same
  ringbuffer

  is an optional feature for VDR devices, so we must not rely on the PMT
