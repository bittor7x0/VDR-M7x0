Description:

My Humax Receiver has a Clock Function that I enjoy very much.
So I decided to write a Plugin for VDR which allows me to see
a small clock in the Top right corner.

The Idea is to set a unused key from your remote control
(for example the key User1) to show the clock.

This can easily be done by adding the following line to
your keymacros.conf

User1 @clock

The clock will be disabled as soon as you press any other button.
Otherwise there would be a mess in the OSD.
