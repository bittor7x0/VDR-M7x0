Requirements
------------

- VDR version >= 1.6.0.

- Logo pack from http://andreas.vdr-developer.org/enigmang


Description
-----------

"EnigmaNG" is a standalone skin based on the "Enigma" text2skin addon.


Compile time configuration
--------------------------

There are some configuration items you need to set before running
"make plugins" in "Make.config":

SKINENIGMA_USE_PLUGIN_EPGSEARCH = 1
If you are using the epgsearch plugin and want to see the number of
timer conflicts in the main menu's info area.

SKINENIGMA_USE_PLUGIN_AVARDS = 1
Include code to support the Avards plugin:
 - Dynamic OSD size depending on current WSS mode.
 - Display current WSS mode in channel info and replay OSDs.

SKINENIGMA_USE_PLUGIN_MAILBOX = 1
If you use the mailbox plugin this will include support for it.

SKINENIGMA_NO_MENULOGO = 1
This turns usage of logos in the main menu completely off. This might
also improve the performance of the menus. EXPERIMENTAL!!!

HAVE_IMAGEMAGICK = 1
If you have installed ImageMagick and want to use images in events'
and recordings' details.  Set to GRAPHICS to use GraphicsMagick.

SKINENIGMA_DISABLE_SIGNALINFO = 1
Do not include code to show signal strength and signal-to-noise ratio.


Installation
------------

> cd /put/your/path/here/VDR/PLUGINS/src
> tar -xzf /put/your/path/here/vdr-skinenigmang-X.Y.Z.tgz
> ln -s skinenigmang-X.Y.Z skinenigmang
OR (for CVS checkout):
> ln -s EnigmaNG skinenigmang
> cd skinenigmang

> cp -df themes/*.theme /path/to/vdrconf/themes/
> cd /put/your/path/here/VDR
> make
> make plugins
> ./vdr -P skinenigmang


Update
------

That's the same procedure as "Installation" but you have to remove
some things before:

- Link to old sources
> cd /put/your/path/here/VDR/PLUGINS/src
> rm -f skinenigmang

- Old themes (only if you didn't change/add them!)
> cd /path/to/vdrconf/themes/
> rm -f EnigmaNG-*.theme


Options
-------

  -i path, --epgimages=path
      Path to the epgimages (Default: <logodir>/epgimages).

  -l path, --logodir=path
      Path to the logos (Default: <vdrconfdir>/plugins/skinenigmang).


Usage
-----

In VDR go to the OSD settings menu and select the skin "EnigmaNG"


Setup Options
-------------

* General
- Try 8bpp single area
  If you don't want to use a single 8bpp area for the OSD you can disable
  it here. If this option is enabled this will not ensure that a single
  area is used, but EnigmaNG will try to use it. If your output deviice
  can handle that area (e.g. softdevice) it will be used. Otherwise multiple
  areas are used.
  This option might be useful for 4MB modded DVB cards because they say they
  can handle the 8bpp single area but the OSD will be slower. If you own such
  a card you may want to play with that option and see if you can increase
  OSD speed.
  NOTE: after commit the settings you have to fully close and re-open the OSD
  to make the change affect.

- Round corners
  If enabled some corners in the OSD will be rounded.

- Full title width
  If enabled the titlebar in the channel info will be drawn above the channel
  logo. This has no effect if channel logos are disabled.

- Show VPS
  Hide or show VPS information in channel info and event info.
  
- Dynamic OSD size
  Get OSD size from Avards or VDR >= v1.5.4.
  NOTE: This requires EnigmaNG compiled with SKINENIGMA_USE_PLUGIN_AVARDS = 1
        and a running Avards plugin.
  
+ Menu OSD
- Show info area in main menu
  This info area is shown in the main menu and it will show the current/next
  timers and the number of timer conflicts (if SKINENIGMA_USE_PLUGIN_EPGSEACH has
  been defined).

- Min width of info area
  This sets the minimum width the info area will have.

- Show messages in menu on (Last line/Help buttons/Free last line)
    Last line      - Messages will hide the last line in the menu OSD.
    Help buttons   - Messages will hide the help buttons in menu OSD.
    Free last line - The same as "Last line" but now the available list items
                     is reduced by one.

- Show scrollbar in menu (no/yes/if required)
  Disable or enable the scrollbar in the menu OSD. If set to "if required" the
  scrollbar will only be visible if scrolling is possible.

+ EPG & Recording Details OSD
- Show auxiliary information (top/bottom)
  Here you can set where you want to have the auxiliary information
  when you open an event's or recording's info screen. This information
  includes for a recording its channel, size, priority, lifetime, audio
  languages and some values that selected plugins (epgsearch, VDRAdmin-AM,
  pin) have set. For an event the audio languages are shown.

- Show recording's size (never/use size.vdr only/always)
  This setting controls if a recording's size is shown in the recording's
  details.
    never             - never show the size
    use size.vdr only - only show the size if size.vdr exists in the
                        recording's directory. The first line of size.vdr is
                        read and has to be the recording's size in megabytes
                        (MB). You can create size.vdr by adding a line like
                              du -sm | cut -f1 >"$2/size.vdr"
                        to your VDR's recording script's "after" and "edited"
                        sections.
    always            - This will also use size.vdr if available. Otherwise
                        it will calculate the size itself.

+ Channel Info OSD
- Show remaining/elapsed time (elapsed/remaining/percent/"elapsed/remaining")
  Here you can set if you want to read the number of minutes an event is
  already running (preceded by "+") or the number of minutes an event will
  run (preceded by "-") or the percent the event has been running in the
  channel info. "elapsed/remaining" will show both elapsed and remaining number
  of minutes.

- Width of progress bar
  The width of the progress bar that visualizes the elapsed time of the current
  event.

- Show progressbar in lists
  This replaces progressbars shown with pipes (e.g. [||  ]) by a graphical
  progressbar.

- Show marker in lists
  If enabled a small circle is drawn in front of the selected item in lists.

- Show status symbols (no/yes/active only)
  Display the status symbols in channel info and recording's progress info.
  "yes" will always show all symbols and "active only" will only show the active
  (= hilighted) ones.

- Show flags
  If enabled graphical flags are drawn for the audio channel languages if the
  requested flag file exists. Else language's abbreviation is drawn.

- Show WSS mode symbols

  NOTE: This requires EnigmaNG compiled with SKINENIGMA_USE_PLUGIN_AVARDS = 1
        and a running Avards plugin.

* Fonts
  If you've set the VDR OSD option "Use small font" to "skin dependent" then
  you can set your preferred fonts for various areas. If you've patched additional
  fonts into VDR you need to set the SKINENIGMA_FONTS define (see above) to see
  them in the list of available fonts.

- OSD title
- Messages
- Date
- Help keys
- Channelinfo: title
- Channelinfo: subtitle
- Channelinfo: language
- List items
- Info area: timers title
- Info area: timers text
- Info area: warning title
- Info area: warning text
- Details: title
- Details: subtitle
- Details: date
- Details: text
- Replay: times
- Fixed Font
  Set the font for the named area.
  You can set the TrueTypeFont to use by pressing the blue key.
  Then you can select one of the TrueTypeFonts known to fontconfig
  and set it's size and width.

* EPGSearch 
  NOTE: only visible if epgsearch support is compiled in

- Number of Reruns (0 - 10)
  The number of reruns to show in an event's info.

- Use Subtitle for reruns (never/if exists/always)
  If set to "never" all events will match that _contain_ the current event's
  title in their title, e.g. if title is "Brisant" it will also find
  "Brisant Classix".
  If set to "if exists" it will use the subtitle to find reruns if the
  current event contains a subtitle. This will also require a full title match,
  e.g. if title is "Brisant" and subtitle is "Boulevard Magazin" it will find
  only events with title and subtitle being exactly "Brisant" and "Boulevard
  Magazin". It won't find events named "Brisant Classix" or "Brisant" without
  subtitle.
  If set to "always" it will always use the subtitle even if it's empty. As a
  sideeffect also the event titles must match exactly, e.g. if title is
  "Tagesschau" it will only find events named "Tagesschau" and not "Tagesschau
  vor 30 Jahren".

- Show timer conflicts
  Enable or disable showing the number of timer conflicts in the main menu's
  info area.
  

Notes
-----

- Only XPM format is supported for channel logos: 80x80 pixels and
  13 colors (6 colors on DXR3) or less recommended.

- If you'll add new channels logos on the fly, remember to flush the
  channel logo cache.
