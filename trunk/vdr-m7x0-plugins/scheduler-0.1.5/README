Requirements:
- vdr >= 1.5.1 or 
- vdr-1.4.5 with the backport of the new shutdown handler (http://www.udo-richter.de/vdr/patches.html#shutdown)

Description:

This plugin allows to control external jobs from within VDR. This is
especially useful if your VDR is not running continiously. Sample 
applications could be an EPG update or backups.

Features:

- optional wakeup of VDR to execute a job (no dummy timers needed anymore)
- prevent a shutdown while a job is still executed
- optional announcements of job start/finish via OSD
- start external jobs via SVDRP in the context of VDR
- display current and previous job output

The main menu lists all jobs that where permanently created. 
A leading '>' indicates that the job is active and will be executed at 
the given times. A leading '#' indicates that the job is currently running.

The keys red, green, yellow are used to edit, add or delete jobs. The key blue
can be used to execute a job for manual starting or to cancel a running job. 
With key ok one gets a menu which displays some information about the job, 
like its last start time and its output.

The edit menu of a job consists of 
- Activate: to enable/disable the automatic start
- Description: a short description of the job
- Command: the actual command to be executed
- Minute, Hour, Weekday, Day, Month: 
  Here you can specify the start times with a syntax similar to cron:
  - '*' or empty means any value
  - a list is separated with a ',' like in '1,5,10'
  - you can also specify ranges like '1-12'
  - ranges can have a step value like '0-23/2' which means '0,2,4,6,...'
  Note: weekdays start with '0'=sunday, '1'=monday,...
- Wakeup VDR: enable this if VDR should wakeup for this task
- OSD announce: select one of the values to get informed about the 
  start/finish of a task
- Save ... logs: save the output of the last ... execution
- Kill after ... minutes: kills a job after the given minutes of 
  execution to avoid endless jobs (0 disables the feature)

At the end of the edit menu you can see a list of the next starting times
according to your settings.

You can also use the SVDRP interface to start existing or temporary tasks:

svdrpsend.pl plug scheduler RUNT <taskname>
  This will execute an existing task that matches the description <taskname>
  The return value is the task ID.
  

svdrpsend.pl plug scheduler RUNC <command>
  This will execute the specified command. VDR will not shutdown before that
  task has finished. The return value is a task ID that can be used
  in following:

svdrpsend.pl plug scheduler STAT <taskId>
  This returns if the task is still running or not.

further svdrp commands (LSTT, NEWT, DELT, EDIT) exist to list all tasks, 
create, delete or edit them.

Installation:

This is done the common way:
- unpack the source package in <VDR-src-dir>/PLUGINS/src
- link it with 'ln -s <Plugin-src-dir> <VDR-src-dir>/PLUGINS/src/scheduler'
- call 'make plugins' in <VDR-src-dir>

Parameters:

To enable logging you can pass the parameters

  -l file,  --logfile=file to specify a specific logfile for scheduler
  -v n,  --verbose=n       verbose level for logfile with n = 0..3


Habe fun!
