     If the 'channels.conf' file contains "group separators" you can switch through these groups by pressing the "Left" and "Right" key while no menu is being displayed. The channel display will show the name of the group, and if you press the "Ok" button while the group name is being displayed, you will switch to the first channel of that group.

     Channel groups can be whatever you decide them to be. You can either group your channels by "Bouquet", by language, genre or whatever your preferences may be.
