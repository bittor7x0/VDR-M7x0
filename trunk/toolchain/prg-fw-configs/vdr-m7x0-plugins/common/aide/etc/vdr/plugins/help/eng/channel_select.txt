     There are four ways to select a channel:

         -   With no On Screen Menu displayed press the "Up" or "Down" key to switch to the next higher or lower channel.
         -   Press the "Menu" button to bring up the On Screen Menu, select "Channels" and browse through the list with the "Up" and "Down" key; to switch to the selected channel press "Ok".
         -   Directly type in the channel number with the numeric keys ('0'..'9'); if no key is pressed for about one second, the digits collected so far will define the channel number.
         -   From the "Now", "Next" and "Event" menus (accessible through the "Schedule" menu) by pressing the "Blue" button.

     Pressing the '0' key in normal viewing mode toggles between the current and the previous channel. A channel is considered "previous" if it has been selected for at least 3 seconds.

     After switching to a different channel the channel number and name, as well as the current time are displayed at the top of the screen. If available, the 'current/next' information will be displayed below this line. This display automatically goes away aft er about five seconds, or if any key is pressed. To bring up the channel display without switching channels you can press the "Ok" button.
