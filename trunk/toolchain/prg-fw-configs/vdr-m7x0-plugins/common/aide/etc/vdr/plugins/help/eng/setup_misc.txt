Min. event timeout = 30
Min. user inactivity = 120

     If the command line option '-s' has been set, VDR will automatically shutdown the computer if the next timer event is at least MinEventTimeout minutes in the future, and the user has been inactive for at least MinUserInactivity minutes. Setting MinUserInac tivity to 0 disables the automatic shutdown, while still retaining the possibility to manually shutdown the computer.
