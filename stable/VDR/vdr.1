.TH vdr 1 "07 Jan 2007" "1.4.5" "Video Disk Recorder"
.SH NAME
vdr - the Video Disk Recorder
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vdr
[options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B vdr
implements a complete digital Set-Top Box and Video Recorder.
It can work with signals received from satellites (DVB-S) as
well as cable (DVB-C) and terrestrial (DVB-T) signals.

At least one DVB card is required to run \fBvdr\fR. With it you can watch
live TV while recording one or more other broadcasts from the same transponder.
It is also possible to start watching a recorded programme before the live
broadcast has ended (\fBtime shifting\fR). In order to record from different
transponders simultaneously two or more DVB cards are necessary.
By default \fBvdr\fR can support up to four
DVB cards. The primary DVB card (the one your TV set is connected to) has
to be a "full featured" card, which means it must contain an MPEG decoder
and provide audio and video signal outputs.

\fBvdr\fR uses the On Screen Display of the DVB card to display its menus.
It can be controlled by the PC keyboard, a home built "Remote Control Unit"
(RCU) or the "Linux Infrared Remote Control" (LIRC).

Remote access is possible via the "Simple Video Disk Recorder Protocol" (SVDRP),
which can be accessed on port 2001, for instance by \fBtelnet\fR.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-a\  cmd ,\ \-\-audio= cmd
Send Dolby Digital audio to stdin of command \fIcmd\fR.
.TP
.BI \-c\  dir ,\ \-\-config= dir
Read config files from directory \fIdir\fR
(default is to read them from the video directory).
.TP
.B \-d, \-\-daemon
Run in daemon mode (implies \-\-no\-kbd).
.TP
.BI \-D\  num ,\ \-\-device= num
Use only the given DVB device (\fInum\fR = 0, 1, 2...).
There may be several \fB\-D\fR options (by default all DVB devices will be used).
.TP
.BI \-E\  file ,\ \-\-epgfile= file
Write the EPG data into the given \fIfile\fR
(default is \fI/video/epg.data\fR).
Use \fB\-E\-\fR to disable this.
If \fIfile\fR is a directory, the file \fIepg.data\fR
will be created in that directory.
.TP
.BI \-g,\ \-\-grab= dir
Write images from the SVDRP command GRAB into the
given directory \fIdir\fR. \fIdir\fR must be the full path name of an
existing directory, without any "..", double '/'
or symlinks. By default, or if \fB\-g\-\fR is given,
grabbing images to disk is disabled.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Print a help message and exit.
.TP
.BI \-l\  level ,\ \-\-log= level
Set logging to \fIlevel\fR.
\fB0\fR\ =\ no logging, \fB1\fR\ =\ errors only,
\fB2\fR\ =\ errors and info, \fB3\fR\ =\ errors, info and debug.
The default logging level is \fB3\fR.
If logging should be done to LOG_LOCAL\fIn\fR instead of
LOG_USER, add '.n' to LEVEL, as in 3.7 (n=0..7).
.TP
.BI \-L\  dir ,\ \-\-lib= dir
Search for plugins in directory \fIdir\fR (default is ./PLUGINS/lib).
There can be several \fB\-L\fR options with different \fIdir\fR values.
Each of them will apply to the \fB\-P\fR options following it.
.TP
.BI \-\-lirc[= path ]
Use a LIRC remote control device.
If \fIpath\fR is omitted, vdr uses \fI/dev/lircd\fR.
.TP
.B \-m, \-\-mute
Mute audio of the primary DVB device at startup.
.TP
.B \-\-no\-kbd
Don't use the keyboard as an input device.
.TP
.BI \-p\  port ,\ \-\-port= port
Use \fIport\fR for SVDRP. A value of \fB0\fR turns off SVDRP.
The default SVDRP port is \fB2001\fR.
You need to edit the file \fIsvdrphosts.conf\fR in order to enable
access to the SVDRP port.
.TP
.BI \-P\  options ,\ \-\-plugin= options
Load a plugin, defined by the given \fIoptions\fR.
The first word in \fIoptions\fR must be the name of an existing \fBvdr\fR
plugin, optionally followed by a blank separated list of command line options
for that plugin. If \fIoptions\fR contains any blanks, you need to enclose it
in quotes, like for example

\fBvdr \-P "abc \-a \-b xyz"\fR

which would load a plugin named \fBabc\fR, giving it the command line options
\fB\-a\ \-b\ xyz\fR. If you want to load all available plugins (without any
particular options) you can use

\fBvdr \-P "*"\fR

(note the quotes around the asterisk to prevent wildcard expansion).
.TP
.BI \-\-rcu[= path ]
Use a serial port remote control device.
If \fIpath\fR is omitted, vdr uses \fI/dev/ttyS1\fR.
.TP
.BI \-r\  cmd ,\ \-\-record= cmd
Call \fIcmd\fR before and after a recording. See the file \fIINSTALL\fR for
more information.
.TP
.BI \-s\  cmd ,\ \-\-shutdown= cmd
Call \fIcmd\fR to shutdown the computer. See the file \fIINSTALL\fR for more
information.
.TP
.BI \-t\  tty ,\ \-\-terminal= tty
Set the controlling terminal.
.TP
.BI \-u\  user ,\ \-\-user= user
Run as user \fIuser\fR in case vdr was started as user 'root'.
Starting vdr as 'root' is necessary if the system time shall
be set from the transponder data, but for security reasons
vdr can switch to a lesser privileged user id during normal
operation.
.TP
.BI \-\-vfat
Encode special characters in recording names to avoid problems
with VFAT file systems.
.TP
.BI \-v\  dir ,\ \-\-video= dir
Use \fIdir\fR as video directory.
The default is \fI/video\fR.
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version
Print version information and exit.
.TP
.BI \-w\  sec ,\ \-\-watchdog= sec
Activate the watchdog timer with a timeout of \fIsec\fR seconds.
A value of \fB0\fR (default) disables the watchdog.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.TP
.B 0
Successful program execution.
.TP
.B 1
An error has been detected which requires the DVB driver and \fBvdr\fR
to be reloaded.
.TP
.B 2
An non-recoverable error has been detected, \fBvdr\fR has given up.
