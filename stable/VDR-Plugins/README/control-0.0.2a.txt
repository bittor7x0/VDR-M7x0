Description
-----------

The 'control' plugin brings the ability to VDR to control
the hole OSD over a telnet client.

To reach this, 'control' listens on a network socket
(default is port 2002). If a client wants to connect, VDR
checks if that client is allowed to connect to VDR (see in
the documentation of VDR about the svdrphosts.conf file for
more info). If the connection is etablished, 'control'
sends the curent OSD state to the client. Also all key
stroks at the client side are redirected to VDR.



Installation
------------

Decompress the current version of the 'control' plugin to the
directory in wich your VDR plugins are installed (e.g.
/usr/local/src/VDR/PLUGINS/src):

cd /usr/local/src/VDR/PLUGINS/src
tar -xzvf vdr-control-x.x.x.tgz
ln -s control-x.x.x control


Then go back to the VDR directory and build your plugins:

cd ../../..
make plugins


Now you can use the plugin

./vdr -Pcontrol

Or, if you want to use an other network port (e.g. port 2005):

./vdr -P"control -p 2005"
