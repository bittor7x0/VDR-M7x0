Description:

  Simple autotimer plugin for vdr.

  This plugin creates timers for matching EPG events.
  Rules are specified in autotimer.spec file (example file is included 
  in plugin package).
  autotimer.spec file must be stored in vdr plugin's config directory
  (by default /video/plugins/).
  
  Fast EPG search for current and next events is done every time 
  EPG events have been changed, so autotimer catches events on 
  channels without full EPG (when there are only current and next 
  event information available).

  Full EPG search is done after startup and every 24 hours.

  Full scan can be "forced" by selecting plugin setup menu entry.


TODO

  Avoid recording same program twice in case of re-transmissions
