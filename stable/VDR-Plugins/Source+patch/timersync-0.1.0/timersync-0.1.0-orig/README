Description:

  This plugin synchronizes timers between client VDR and server VDR.

  All recordings are done at server, but all timers are visible 
  in both VDR instances.

  NOTE: LOADING THIS PLUGIN WILL DISABLE RECORDING !

  Plugin should be loaded only at client side. At startup it checks
  if it is running at server and refuses to start.

  Timers are periodically read from server using SVDRP. All changes 
  to timers are immediately committed to server. Whole process is totally 
  invisible to user, and in user point of view there are no differences 
  compared to browsing timer list or EPG at the server.

Limitations:

  If timer is currently recording it can't be edited or removed.

  If timer is edited at server while it is being edited at client, 
  changes made at client are lost.

Requirements:

  vdr-svdrpservice plugin 0.0.2 or later (version 0.0.3 recommended)
  from http://vdr.schmirler.de/

Configuration:

  With svdrpservice version 0.0.2 it is necessarily to define 
  VDR server address for synctimers plugin:

     -P"synctimers --server=1.2.3.4:2001"

  With svdrpservice version 0.0.3 server address can be configured in 
  svdrpservice plugin setup manu.
