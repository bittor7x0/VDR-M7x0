epgsearchcats.conf(5)      Epgsearch Version 0.9.22      epgsearchcats.conf(5)



NAME
       epgsearchcats.conf - Configuration of the additional EPG information

DESCRIPTION
       Some EPG providers deliver additional EPG information like the type of
       event, the video and audio format, cast,...

       Using tvm2vdr or epg4vdr you can import this into vdr.  To use this
       information with search timers one has to configure it with the file
       epgsearchcats.conf in your plugins config directory.

       Sample files for epgsearchcats.conf are delivered with the plugin in
       the directory 'conf'.

       Simply copy the one that fits for you to your plugins config directory
       with filename epgsearchcats.conf and then have a look to the search
       timers edit menu (after a restart of VDR).

       Since setting up a new epgsearchcats.conf is a lot of work, I've added
       a small tool 'createcats', that makes the biggest part of the job. It
       should have been compiled with the plugin and exists in the sources
       directory.

       See createcats(1) for information about how to use it.

       Internals: epgsearch scans the summary of an event for the category
       name followed by ': ' for all categories that have a corresponding
       value set in the search timer. The search is case sensitive regarding
       the category name as also the value.

SYNTAX
        ID|category name|name in menu|values separated by ','(option)|searchmode(option)

        - 'ID' should be a unique positive integer
          (changing the id later on will force you to re-edit your search timers!)
        - 'category name' is the name as delivered by the EPG provider, e.g. 'Genre'
        - 'name in menu' is the name displayed in epgsearch.
        - 'values' is an optional list of possible values
        - 'searchmode' specifies the search mode:
          0 - the whole term must appear as substring
          1 - all single terms (delimiters are ',', ';', '|' or '~')
              must exist as substrings. This is the default search mode.
          2 - at least one term (delimiters are ',', ';', '|' or '~')
              must exist as substring.
          3 - matches exactly
          4 - regular expression
