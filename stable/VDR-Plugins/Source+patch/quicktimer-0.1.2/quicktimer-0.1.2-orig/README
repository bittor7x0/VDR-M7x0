Description:

  Create timers by entering channel, day and start time.

  Creating timers from TV magazines is fast and does not require 
  browsing EPG.

  VDR EPG must contain information for the event 
  (start time, end time and event name are taken from EPG).

Usage:

  1) Select "Create timer" from vdr main menu.

  2) If channel is wrong, press "Up" and change 
     channel. Move back to Start Time.

  3) Enter last number of day (ex. if date is 21/8/2004 press 1),
     or press Down if day is correct.

  4) Enter start time of program (or any time at middle of program).
     When enough digits have been entered you should see name 
     of the program on next line.

  5) Press "Red" or Ok to create the timer.
