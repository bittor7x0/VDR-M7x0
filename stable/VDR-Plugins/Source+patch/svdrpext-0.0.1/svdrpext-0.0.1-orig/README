Description:
------------
Extensions to the SVDRP command set.

Currently only some OSD related commands required by the remoteosd
plugin have been implemented.

Command overview:
-----------------
All the OSD commands return the current contents of the OSD as indicated
by the VDR status interface. On success the response code is 920. If
the requested information is currently unavailable (e.g. OSD is closed)
930 is returned.

The following OSD commands are available:
- OSDT (title)
- OSDM (message / status line)
- OSDH (color button titles)
- OSDI items_per_page (list of items)
- OSDX (text block)

Compatibility:
--------------
This plugin should also work with VDR 1.3 if you have at least 1.3.30.
Up until VDR 1.3.44 there's a bug in the SVDRP code. You can either
patch VDR or patch the plugin to work around the problem.

This is the patch for VDR:

            else
               Reply(500, "Command unrecognized: \"%s\"", cmd);
            }

If you decide to patch the plugin instead, proceede as follows:
- cd VDR/PLUGINS/src/svdrpext
- patch -p0 < patches/svdrpext-escape.patch

Now recompile and install the svdrpext plugin.
