VDR Plugin 'clock' Revision History
----------------------------------

2004-08-09: Version 0.0.5b1
- Adapted to VDR 1.3.x (tanks to Alexander Hans)
- Added Clock Type "Analog modern" (tanks to Alexander Hans)
- Added Clock Type "MorphOS" (tanks to Alexander Hans)
- Added Clock Type "TuxClock"  (tanks to Alexander Hans)
- Known Problem: TuxClock sometimes only shows the pinguin and no clock.
	TuxClock also causes crashes sometimes. So use this option with care.


2003-04-14: Version 0.0.4

- Added French language (thanks to Beguin Pierre-Henri)

2003-02-05: Version 0.0.3

- Changed the name of the plugin from "Time" to "Clock"
- Made the Setup Menu a bit more dynamic (Still not like it should be)
- Added an Internet Clock (00:00am = 0; 12:00pm = 1000)
- Added a Tea Cocker. With this you can enter a time to count down from.
  It will only work as long you press no button. When you press a button
  before your "tea is ready" the plugin remembers the "state" of your tea
  till an hour after your tea got ready. If you don't activate the plugin
  until this time the plugin will reset the state of your "tea". This idea
  came out of the idea of a "pizza plugin" from the vdrportal
  (http://www.vdrportal.de)
