Description:

This is a plugin for the Video Disc Recorder (VDR). It can be used to be reminded to certain things
you will maybe forget when watching TV. You can also let it switch to a channel or execute
a command from VDRs commands.conf at a certain point of time.
Examples: tea is ready, switch to a channel, shutdown VDR after recording ...

INSTALL

Installation as usual. Untar the archive into VDRs plugins source directory. Create symlink and 
type make plugins.
To load the plugin edit your vdr startscript and add -Peggtimer. The plugin has no commandline parameters.

You may copy the sample file eggtimer.conf into VDRs plugins configuration directory. You may wish to edit 
the file to fit your needs. You can define templates there. See the sample file eggtimer.conf for syntax.

USAGE

When VDR is running you can start the plugin via the main menu. You will see a menu. You can choose a template and
may also modify the settings below. After hitting RED or OK the countdown will start.
The plugin will repeat an OSD info message when time is over. You can stop the clock at every time via the main menu.

NOTICE

Use it at your own risk. Bug reports and feature requests are welcome.

Have fun
