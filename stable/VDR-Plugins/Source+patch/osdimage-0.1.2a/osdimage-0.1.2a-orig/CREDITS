VDR Plugin 'osdimage' CREDITS
-----------------------------

While developing this plugin I received a lot of direct and indirect support
from different people, which I want to thank here:

 - Martin Strasser
   for getting me started with C++
 - Sascha Volkenandt
   I took several code-parts of his plugins
 - Andreas Weinberger
   Since I use his skin 'lightblue256' (really like it ... any plans on further
	development? ;-) ) I tried to use some design-parts for the plugin to make
	it "fit in".
 - Patrick Fischer
   for helping me debug the
 - The people at vdr-portal for helping me adopting the plugin to various
   linux-configurations
