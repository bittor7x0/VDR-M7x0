     All recordings are listed in the "Recordings" menu. Browse through the list with the "Up" and "Down" button and press "Ok" (or the "Red" button) to start playback. New recordings are marked with an '*'. If the Setup parameter RecordingDirs has been set and there are recordings from repeating timers organized in a subdirectory structure, only the directory is displayed and it can be opened by pressing "Ok" (or the "Red" button). A directory entry displays the total number of recordings within that directory ( and any possible subdirectory thereof) as well as the total number of new recordings (as opposed to a recording's entry, which displays the date and time of the recording).

     If the setup parameter "Use episode name" was turned on when a recording took place, VDR adds the "Episode name" (which is usually the name of the episode in case of a series) to the recording's name. The "Recordings" menu then displays all recordings of a repeating timer in chronological order, since these are usually the individual episodes of a series, which you may want to view in the order in which they were broadcast.

     Playback can be stopped via the "VDR" menu by selecting "Stop replaying", or by pressing the "Blue" button outside the menu. A previously stopped playback session can be resumed by pressing the "Blue" button in the "VDR" menu.
