     You can start recording the current channel by pressing the "Red" button in the "VDR" menu. This will create a timer event named "@channelname" that starts at the current time and by default records for 3 hours. If you want to modify the recording time you need to edit the timer. Stop instant recording by pressing the "Menu" button and selecting "Stop Recording", or by disabling the timer. The default priority, lifetime and recording time can be defined in the "Setup/Recording" menu.
