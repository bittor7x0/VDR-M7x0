     If the current channel provides different audio tracks (typically for different languages), the "Green" button in the "VDR" menu can be pressed to toggle between these. There can be two different audio PIDs per channel, assuming that typically a channel broadcasts a country specific language plus the movie's original soundtrack.

     Recordings made form such channels will contain both audio tracks, and when replaying the desired audio track can be selected the same way.
