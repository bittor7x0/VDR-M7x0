     If you want to pause the live programme you are just watching, simple press "Menu/Yellow" or "Pause" on your remote control. VDR will start an instant recording of the current channel (just as if you had pressed "Menu/Red" or "Record") and immediately begin replaying that recording. Replay will be put into "pause" mode, so you can attend to whatever it was that disturbed your live viewing session. Once you're back, simply press the "Up" or "Play" button and you'll be watching the current channel in time shift mode, right from the point where you left off. The instant recording VDR has started will use the parameters for "Pause priority" and "Pause lifetime" as defined in the "Setup/Recording" menu. Recording time will be the same as for any other instant recording, s o by default it will record 3 hours (which should be enough for any normal broadcast).
