VDR Plugin 'streamdev' Revision History
---------------------------------------

2004-??-??: Version 0.3.3

- dropped support for non-ts streaming in vdr-to-vdr clients
- implemented packet buffer that seems to improve distortions
- greatly re-worked device selection on server and client
  (vdr-to-vdr clients should behave exactly like clients with one card,
  can't test conditional access, though)
- now printing an error and exiting if streamdevhosts.conf is not existing
- increased client stream priority to 1
- implemented remote schedule to program remote timers directly from schedule
- the servers are turned on by default now
- new setup parameters "Bind to IP" for both servers for binding to a specific
  interface
- re-implemented section streaming (turned off by default, see setup menu)
- implemented a possibility to prevent a shutdown when clients are connected
  (patch VDR with patches/vdr-pluginactivity.diff if you want this feature)
- implemented channel listing through channels.htm(l) URI

- Server is correctly deactivated, so it can be faultlessly reactivated
- Did some major code cleanup
