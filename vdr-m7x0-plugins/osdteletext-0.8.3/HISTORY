2005-08-16: version 0.5.1

- show page if it was initially not found
  but is received later
  (suggested by Luca Olivetti)

  which the plugin is closed. Without timeout the plugin would
  prevent VDR's auto-shutdown mechanism if it remains open.

  setup option.

  (thanks to Ville Skyttä)

2005-04-21: version 0.5

  Udo Richter:
- font subsystem now supports Teletext level 1.
  Fonts are provided for English, German, French,
  Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Swedish and Finnish.
  The correct font is chosen automatically.
- support for "boxed mode" (newstickers, subtitles):
  in 4Bpp mode the area not covered by the box
  will be completely transparent
- OSD can now be aligned on screen:
  - in horizontal alignment mode, 0 means on the left, 
    50 in the center and 100 on the right
  - in vertical alignment mode, 0 means at the top,
    50 in the center and 100 at the bottom
  - default is central alignment
- changed palette system, no longer depending on 
  order of indexing
- fixed compilation failure with gcc 2.95
- changed OSD minimum size from 480x324 to 320x250
- some bugfixes and comments in txtrecv.c
  Marcel Wiesweg:
- avoid crash and improve behavior when an
  invalid channel number is entered

2005-03-30: version 0.5-pre1

  Udo Richter:
- extensive rewrite of display code
- removed display.*, txtbitmap.*, colormapping.h
- added txtrender.*, displaybase.*, display.*
- menu.c adapted to new display engine
- speed improvements by incremental drawing
- strict adherence to standard

2005-03-21: version 0.4.9-inofficial

- rewrite of scaling and drawing code, better scaling
  algorithm, removed inefficient double painting.
  Increases speed by a factor of 4. (Udo Richter)
- minor fixes for pagenumber, channel number and clock
  fields to minimize overdrawing (Rolf Ahrenberg)
- fix for graphical errors if normal characters are 
  introduced after double high ones (Rolf Ahrenberg)
- fix in receiving code to make osdteletext work
  with some Swedish channels (thanks to Magnus Andersson)
- pseudo target in Makefile allows a simple "make".
  Previously, this would fail and you needed "make all"

2005-03-03: version 0.4.2

- fixes for double-high characters, scaling and localization
  (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg for his patch edition)
- adapted to VDR API >= 1.3.18, reentrancy fixes
- added Spanish and Catalan translation
  (thanks to Luca Olivetti)
- create stored files with 644 permissions
  (suggested by Andreas Brachold)

2004-09-21: version 0.4.1

- fixed problem with undefined file permissions 
  of created files (thanks to whoever created the patch)
- fixed hexadecimal/decimal misinterpretation for "Jump to" 
  key bindings (thanks to Peter Bieringer for pointing this out)
- cosmetic change: key Left when entering channel number
  now resets the cursor by one position, other keys stop
  entering of page number

2004-06-18: version 0.4

- ported to VDR 1.3/1.4 series (>=1.3.8 now required)
  This mostly involved changes in the OSD graphics code,
- now supports OSDs with color depth of 3 
  (thanks to Sascha Volkenandt)
- rewrote the storage system:
  - cache directory is now configurable (option -d)
    Default value is still /vtx to allow seamless migration,
    but /tmp/vtx is recommended (conforms to LSB etc.)
  - changed the default file format: Now more than one
    page is stored in one file. On filesystems that depend
    on a blocksize the increases storage efficiency.
    For tmpfs the improvement factor is approx. 4.
  - The old system is still available via a
    command line option (though it now uses a slightly
    different naming)
  - when no more space is available on disk
    or a specified number of harddisk space is exceeded
    (option -n) the folder least recently modified
    will be deleted.
    On exit, all files will be deleted, i.e.
    (!) on exit, all files with suffix .vtx
    below the storage directory will be deleted
  - the option -r is now obsolete (will be ignored)
    option -R/--no-receive is deprecated
- code cleanups, removed broken or unused code
- fixed quite a few bugs
- Added Russian translation (thanks to Vyacheslav Dikonov)

2003-12-2: version 0.3.2

- receiver now uses a ring buffer and a thread to reduce
  time spent in Receive() function, thus delaying VDR's
  receiver thread (several people reported problems
  with bitstreamout - thanks to Christian Jacobsen
  and Dr. Werner Fink)
- fixed and improved the newly introduced receiver thread
  (thanks to Dr. Werner Fink)
- fixed a bug that if there is a double high title on a page,
  the last line on that page will be missing
  (fixed by Rolf Ahrenberg)
- fixed Finnish translation (thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg)
- added Italian translation (thanks to "kikko77")
- fixed bug that you could not enter 0 when switching
  channel (thanks to Dietmar Hilbrich)

2003-04-28: version 0.3.1

- added support for DXR3 systems. Patches contributed by Kai Moeller
  and Sascha Volkenandt, thanks to them.
- the "0" if pressed as first digit now switches between current
  and last page (as VDR does it with channels)
- fixed autosuspend thread

2003-04-03: version 0.3

- fixed two serious memory leaks, thanks to Martin Pley
- added feature to automatically update the page if it changed.
- moved color definitions to colormapping.h
- made width and height configurable, independent from, but with the same
  mechanism as VDR
- made setup menu items dynamic, i.e. the "Page Number" entries are hidden
  when "Jump to..." is not selected
- Experimental: added option to suspend the receiving automatically
  for 5min after 30s. This may enable you to use your TV set's 
  teletext decoder if you like to. (patch to VDR needed)
- Experimental: added an action to immediately suspend receiving,
  respectively reenable it
- added an action to switch the background color between the value
  you configured in the setup and black
- improved color handling when foreground and background
  color are the same, thanks to Martin Pley
- fixed small bug in ChangePageRelative, thanks to Martin Pley
- improvements in page switching, thanks to Martin Pley
- rewrote parts of the README
- added a German README.DE
- several fixes and code clean-ups



2003-02-26: version 0.2.1

- fixed two compiling problems with gcc versions other than 3.2
  (asprintf, <map>)
- included Finnish translations, thanks to Lauri Tischler
- improved Makefile, now uses install instead of mkdir/cp

2003-02-15: version 0.2

- Copied code to receive and save teletext data from original teletext plugin.
  (appreciating Peter Seyringer's great work)
- added command line option to enable the receiving code
- added setup options to make key bindings fully configurable.
  For each key you can choose between the three actions "Zoom", "Half page" or
  "Switch channel" or use it to jump to a page
- added setup option to make background transparency configurable 
  (0...255, VDR's default value being 127)
- included Emil Naepflein's patch to improve changing pages relatively
- added feature to view saved pages of other channels than the current
  ("Switch Channel"). Last pages are remembered over channel switching.
- fixed bug when the upper half of a page was not automatically shown
  when using the number keys
- page and channel numbers now persist when returning to VDR
- added clock which can regularly be updated.
  (the clock shows the system time, which may definitely be different
   from the time broadcast via teletext)
- added setup option to enable clock
- now copies README to ../../man, as Reinhard Walter Buchner suggested


2003-02-05: Version 0.1

- Initial revision.
