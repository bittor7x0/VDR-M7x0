Description:

This is a plugin that demonstrates how to use filebrowser's classes in your own plugin.
I decided against relying on Service() for I don't see much advantages with this but the problem that all plugins using this would depend on the existence of the filebrowser plugin on the target system.
For your plugin, you would copy the files I have linked into this directory to be really independent.

You have three ways to use the classes:

1) Create a filebrowser menu and add some custom commands (inherited from cFilebrowserCommand)
   - this is covered in filebrowserdemo.c
   You can recycle internal filebrowser commands like Sources, Mark, Unmark etc.
   Your custom commands should set State to a value that you can read in the menu that hosts
   the filebrowser menu.

2) If you just want to show a list of files and have the user press OK, you want to inherit from
   cOsdMenuFilebrowser and override ProcessKey to catch this keystroke.
   Cast the current entry to cOsdItemFileEntry to check for a directory and call cOsdMenuFilebrowser's
   ProcessKey method to handle that, do your own stuff if it is a file you want to work on.

3) Mix 1) and 2)
