Description:
============
This plugin reads the <vdr-conf-path>/sources.conf and  
parses the coresponding transponderlist  (.tpl file),
then it scans this sat and updates/appends all found channels to
the current channel list.


Installation:
=============
- Unpack the archive to your plugins source directory.
- copy the transponders directory to your plugins-directory
  Note: the tranponder files are NOT compatible any more with those from kikkos channelscan!
- if you want the selection of the satellites to work from west to east (recommended),
  copy the applied sources.conf to your vdr-config directory
- compile vdr and plugins as usual


Commands:
=========
Press right arrow to move selection of satellite eastwards, left for westwards
Press Ok to start a new scan
Press Back to stop a current scan.


Notes:
========
- if you are using the director plugin <= 0.2.7 you *must* apply the supplied
  patch. This one is originally provided by Rangas setup plugin.
- There is a patch in the patches directory needed by older vdr versions.
  Your milage may vary. Please check without patching vdr first.
- you need g++ >= 3.3.x to compile this plugin
Also applied (in the patches-dir) there is a patch to vdr which adds possibility
(switch -k) to name an alternative channellist at vdr startup.
You don't need this for channelscan to work (it always uses the current channellist)
but its here for convenience.

 
******************************* WARNING *******************************
 
This plugin only works with vdr >= 1.3.47 (tested with 1.4.0)
For older versions you have to change  the line
@cp $@ $(LIBDIR)/$@.$(APIVERSION)
to
@cp $@ $(LIBDIR)/$@.$(VDRVERSION)

in neither case expect it to work with vdr < 1.3.18
