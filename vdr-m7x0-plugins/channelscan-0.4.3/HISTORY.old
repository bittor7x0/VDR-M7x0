- Channelscan is now faster because sets the filters for sdt, pat and pmt itself, 
  so it now knows when scanning of a transponder is over.(idea from Luca Olivetti) 
  (write by Thomas Bergwinkl)
- It's now also possible to decide which service types (TV,Radio,NVOD) 
  should be added (write by Thomas Bergwinkl)
- it now checks if the dvb device, which does the scan, is able to
  provide the transponder. So no dvb-c/t devices will be selected for
  channelscan. (write by Thomas Bergwinkl)
- fixed a bug, which crashed vdr if two transponders have the same
  polarization and almost the same frequency (write by Thomas Bergwinkl)
