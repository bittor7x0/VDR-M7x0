Notes
-----
- North American users have the option of applying the ratings patch to VDR.
  Parental and star ratings will then be displayed in fEPG's info window.
  The patch can be found in the 'patches' directory.
  
- PAL mode will not work on full featured cards due to lack of OSD memory.

- If you are using a software output device, you might have to use PAL mode
  even on an NTSC television.

- You might find it useful to add the following line (or something similar) 
  to keymacros.conf
