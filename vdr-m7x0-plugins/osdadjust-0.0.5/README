Description
------------
OSDAdjust is a plugin for VDR that provides a graphical way to adjust size and position for the OSD on screen.
The idea for this Plugin is based on the Screen Setup from vdr-fepg-0.3.1 but the code is rebuild from scratch.
The plugin is able to generate some test pattern to adjust brightness, contrast, color or position for your display.
One of these pattern is borrow from the VDR plugin osdtest256. The others are selfmade and if you think
the color or something else is wrong - please contact me.

Requirements
-------------
VDR >= 1.4.5

-------------
