WHAT
-----
This patch removes the "no translation found for" warnings in the VDR log.

WHY
----
This might be useful if you have enabled the symbols in the main menu
because in that case EnigmaNG has to compare every main menu entry with
a localized text to find out what symbol has to be shown.

FOR
---
This patch has been tested with vanilla VDR 1.4.5 but should apply to other
releases too. Anyway, it's not hard to fix reject...

HOW
---
Change to VDR source directory and run
vdr-1.4.5$ patch <PLUGINS/src/skinenigmang/patches/vdr-1.4.5-no_trans_found.diff
