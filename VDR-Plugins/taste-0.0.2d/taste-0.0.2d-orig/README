Description:

With this plugin, VDR will skip every channel that doesn't match your "taste",
which means that the current programme (if available) is checked against a 
blacklist, and if it matches, a message will be displayed and the channel is 
being skipped.

If you really want to switch to a channel that doesn't match, press Ok while
the message is displayed.

You can add entries to the blacklist by selecting the mainmenu entry "Schedule
not acceptable" or by editing the blacklist within the plugin's setup menu. 
Regular expressions are supported. Beware that to edit and save an entry, both
the submenu and the setup menu must be closed using the "Ok" button.

You have to apply the included patch to VDR to be able to have more than one
inacceptable channel in sequence. Without this patch, only the first one
will be skipped.

The Plugin should support VDRs from 1.3.7 up to current versions.
