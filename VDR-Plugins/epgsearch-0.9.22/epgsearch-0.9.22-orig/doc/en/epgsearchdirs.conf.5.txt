NAME
       epgsearchdirs.conf - List of directories for selecting in epgsearch

DESCRIPTION
       This is one source of the 'Select directory' menu.

       This file contain directories which can be used for search timers or
       ordinary timers.

       The items displayed are read from the following sources:

          * current recording directories
          * current timer directories
          * directories used in search timers
          * directories specified in F<epgsearchdirs.conf>

       The menu merges theses directories and displays only distinct directo-
       ries. With key 'yellow' one can change the depth of the directories
       shown. If there are items, that contain category variables like
       '%genre%', these entries are always shown before any other directories.
       They are also not level dependent, but are always shown with their full
       directory.

       If this menu is called from the timer edit menu and an item is selected
       that contains the variables "%title%" or "%subtitle" then the 'file'
       item of the timer gets cleared, since title or subtitle already exist
       in the 'directory' item.
