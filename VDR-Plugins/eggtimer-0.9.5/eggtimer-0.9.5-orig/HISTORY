VDR Plugin 'eggtimer' Revision History
---------------------------------------

2006-09-28: Version 0.9.5

- VDR 1.4-compatible release
- added Dutch translations (thanks to Thiemo Gehrke from reel-multimedia)

2006-03-27: Version 0.9.4

NOTICE: syntax of the template file eggtimer.conf changed. Please see sample file
for the new syntax and adapt your file

- Command eggtimers do not longer use the index (line number) to identify a command from
  VDRs commands.conf. Instead the title of the command is used. See sample eggtimer.conf
  for more information
  
- when a time (hh:mm) is specified in an eggtimer template and the time has already passed
  at present date the date of the next day is used.
  
- time mode (0,1,2) has no longer to be specified in the eggtimer.conf template file.
  Use 5min, 20sec, 20:15 or now. See the eggtimer.conf sample file for more information

2006-03-25: Version 0.9.3

- Improved message displaying for VDR >= 1.3.37. (thanks to Tobias Grimm for bringing light into this)

  Any problems with VDR crashes related to eggtimer OSD-messages should be gone with
  VDR >= 1.3.37 and vdr-eggtimer >= 0.9.3

  It's a difficult topic because displaying OSD-messages from a background thread (like eggtimer) 
  is available since VDR 1.3.37. Earlier versions do not offer secure ways to display a message 
  from a background thread.
  
  I strongly recommend to use VDR >= 1.3.37 when using OSD message eggtimers.
  
  I do not make any efforts to improve message displaying for older VDR < 1.3.37
  because we are shortly before 1.4 release.
  
- removed -g compiler option since debugging infos are normally not needed.
