Nordlicht's EPG
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This plugin provides an EPG (Electronic Program Guide) similar to VDR's
"What's on now?"-menu. Unlike this it also shows channels without epg-infos.
You can browse the epg with an adjustable step width. It is also possible to
set a time at the setup which you can jump to by keypress, with the keys 1-7
you can jumpo 1-7 days forward. You can enter a time to jump to instantly.
A bargraph at the "What's on now?"-view shows the progress of the running
program. Timers are marked with a clock-icon, recording timers with a 
'REC'-icon. It is possible, also for channels without epg-infos, to set and
delete timers.

Thanks to Rolf Ahrenberg for the finnish translation.
