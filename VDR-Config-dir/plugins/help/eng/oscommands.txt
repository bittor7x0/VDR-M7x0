     The "VDR" menu option "Commands" allows you to execute any system commands defined in the configuration file 'commands.conf' (see vdr(5) for details). The "Commands" option will only be present in the "VDR" menu if a valid 'commands.conf' file containing at least one command definition has been found at program start.

     This feature can be used to do virtually anything, like checking for new mail, displaying the CPU temperature - you name it! All you need to do is enter the necessary command definition into 'commands.conf' and implement the actual command that will be cal led. Such a command can typically be a shell script or a Perl program. Anything that command writes to stdout will be displayed on a result screen after executing the command. This screen will use a 'fixed' font so that you can generate formatted output. In ord er to avoid error messages going to stderr, command definitions should redirect stderr to stdout (see vdr(5)).

     WARNING:
     THE COMMANDS DEFINED IN 'commands.conf' WILL BE EXECUTED UNDER THE SAME USER ID THAT VDR IS RUNNING WITH. BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN DEFINING THESE COMMANDS AND MAKE SURE THEY DON'T HARM YOUR SYSTEM, ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE RUNNING VDR UNDER A HIGH PRIVILEGED USER ID (LIKE 'root').
