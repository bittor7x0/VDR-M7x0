Instructions for building the "new" driver under 2.4.x:
-------------------------------------------------------

(This won't work with *2.6.x* or a kernel version < 2.4.23, so don't
even try...)

0. Introduction
===============

All saa7146 and dvb files are shared with the 2.6.x "dvb-kernel" tree, so
the behaviour should be exactly the same on the DVB side.

In contrast to the "DVB" driver, the "dvb-kernel" driver, however, supports
Video4Linux-2 for the video back end. Due to this, old Video4Linux-1 
applications will run through a compatibility layer, which does not always
work as expected.

The newest "xawtv" version will always work with this driver.

Since kernel 2.4.19, the Video4Linux module "videodev.o" allows you to
register devices with a new mechanism. Due to this, the necessary
Video4Linux-2 modules can be compiled external and loaded as modules at a
later time. These modules are:
- v4l1-compat.o : helper module to translate v4l1 to v4l2
- v4l2-common.o : common functions for all v4l2 drivers
- video-buf.o   : common functions for capturing

So it's necessary that you compile "Video4Linux" support (in the character
devices section) either as a module or statically into the kernel. 

1. Kernels < 2.4.19
===================

The main "videodev.c" source from a 2.4.21 kernel is included in this
directory, but not compiled and installed by default. So if you have a
kernel < 2.4.19, edit the "Makefile" to compile this module as well.

2. bt878 based cards
====================

Have a look at ../README.bt8xx on how to get a bt8x8 based card to run.
If you don't have such a card, you can safely ignore the messages about
unresolved symbols that might appear.

3. Build process
================

The build process uses a local version of the Video4Linux-2  header file
"videodev2.h", that's needed if you want to compile real Video4Linux-2
applications. 

Old v4l1 applicatios *should* work without recompiling, through the
compatiblity layer. 

0) If you plan to use a DVB card with onboard MPEG decoder, you need
to download the necessary firmware from the LinuxTV.org DVB download
page and place it inside the "build-2.4" directory. The most recent
version is "dvb-ttpci-01.fw".

http://www.linuxtv.org/download/dvb/dvb-ttpci-01.fw.gz

1) make clean && ./getlinks && make 

"getlinks" will create the necessary links to the "dvb-kernel" tree.

2) To compile the drivers locally *without* installing (and probably
   overwriting any old driver) do:
      make
      ./insmod.sh load

3) For your convenience, a script called "insmod.sh" is available
to load and unload the driver easily.

Make sure the appropriate frontend module for your hardware is loaded in
"insmod.sh"

4) Try your favourite programs, the behaviour should be exactly the same.
Good luck!

4. In case of problems
======================

If you have problems or questions:

1) Look at the ../TODO file. If the problem is mentionend there,
it will be fixed asap.

2) Ask on the linux-dvb mailing list.
