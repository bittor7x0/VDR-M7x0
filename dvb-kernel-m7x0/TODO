2.6:
[ ] module stuff
- change MODULE_PARM() to module_param(), have a look at
http://lwn.net/Articles/22197/ for details


all:
[ ] code audit
- code audit for return values, ie. change all -1 or -2 return
codes to real ERRNO values. [Hmm, is this done already?]

saa7146:
[ }
- add support for more planar capture modes, so that mp1e/nvrec work out of the box
- replace vmalloc_32() with pci_alloc_consistent() for dma memory stuff

dvb:
[ ] general dvb core stuff
- 2.5.x: replace "video_usercopy()" (or dvb_usercopy()) with
  generic_usercopy(), make a patch for lkml. note: done, awaiting
  approval from lkml

[ ] dvb_demux.c: Fix module removal if in use.
- If rmmod of dvb-core is attempted while demux is in use, 
  by e.g. szap, non-fatal oops will follow: 
  Code;  f88c0823 <[dvb-core]dvb_demux_release+7/18>   <=====
  0:   8b 50 50                  mov    0x50(%eax),%edx   <=====

[ ] budget: Fix coexistence of several ttpci-budget-* modules.
- After one or two rmmod/insmod of dvb-kernel modules suite
  when there are 2 or more different ttpci-budget-* moules,
  an oops is issued during the remmod:
  Code;  f88f01a9 <[dvb-core]dvb_unregister_device+d/2c>   <=====
  0:   89 50 04                  mov    %edx,0x4(%eax)   <=====

[ ] dummy: Add support for dummy (loopback) DVB interface
- People without DVB hardware should be able to load drivers and
  participate in development.

[ ] sw_demux: intelligent 0x47 SYNC.
- each TS packet should start with 0x47 byte. If there is no 0x47 byte
  at expected position, search for first 0x47 byte and check if previous 
  3 188-byte offsets also contain 0x47. If yes, consider this new sync 
  position. vpeirq has to be changed a bit and some changes in sw_demux
  too.
