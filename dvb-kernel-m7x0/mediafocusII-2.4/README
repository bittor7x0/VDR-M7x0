The MediafocusII is an *analog* satellite tv card based on the
saa7146 chipset.

Rolf Siebrecht has written a driver called "mediafocusII-0.0.9.tar.gz",
which was forked off an early version of "Multimedia eXtension Board"
Video4Linux-1 driver.

Unfortunately his homepage has disappeared and he no longer responds to
e-mails. 

This is an attempt by Torsten Tittmann to port the "old" driver to my
new saa7146 driver core. It's basically working.

For further informations, have a look at the project page
http://www.gdv.uni-hannover.de/~hunold1/linux/saa7146/mf2.html
or mail to
<Torsten.Tittmann@gmx.de>.


Compiling and Installation under kernel 2.4:
============================================
ATTENTION, this driver was just an intermediate step to get familiar with
Michael Hunold's saa7146 framework of the official kernel 2.6 code.
Since I got this driver running under kernel 2.6 I will not spend time to
this kernel 2.4 driver.

If you like to use your "TechniSat MediaFocus II" card under kernel 2.4,
you can also use Rolf Siebrecht's original driver "mediafocusII-0.0.9.tar.gz",
which you will find at Michael Hunold's Website (see above) or in the
CVS Repository.
This driver is almost stable and supports the mfII card with more functions
than this driver.


If you like to try this driver, I'll give you some informations for compiling
and installation now (don't use the single quotes!):
- cd into the 'dvb-kernel/mediafocusII-2.4/' directory
- call './getlinks'
- call 'make'
- call 'su -c "make install"'
- call "su -c "depmod -ae; modprobe mfII"'
- ensure that the driver mfII is loaded at startup
- additional information about the needed adaption of xawtv is given at Michaels Website
  (including some example files resp. tools)



Meaning of module debug parameter:
==================================
The parameter are bit masked (following the new saa7146 driver core):

-  1 = 0x01 = 0000 0001 > DEB_S(x)         /* simple debug messages */
-  2 = 0x02 = 0000 0010 > DEB_D(x)         /* more detailed debug messages */
-  4 = 0x04 = 0000 0100 > DEB_EE(x)        /* print enter and exit of functions */
-  8 = 0x08 = 0000 1000 > DEB_I2C(x)       /* i2c debug messages */
- 16 = 0x10 = 0001 0000 > DEB_VBI(x)       /* vbi debug messages */
- 32 = 0x20 = 0010 0000 > DEB_INT(x)       /* interrupt debug messages */
- 64 = 0x40 = 0100 0000 > DEB_CAP(x)       /* capture debug messages */
