Description:

This is a little plugin, that allows you to select and start other
plugins, even if there are not shown in the main menu. You can also
access the setup menu of a plugin. If available you can also display 
a little man page about the plugin. This is useful, if a plugin has
a comlicated interface with many different keys for usage, like the
dvd plugin.
I´ ve written this, first as a little programming exercise and second,
because I'm a little lazy :-)
Some plugins are not used very often and have eventually a setup entry
to hide them in the main menu. If one wants to use them now, its a
little bit annoying to jump through the menus, enable them, use
them and reverse the whole thing.

The plugin shows a list of all other plugins and launches the selected
plugin with the "OK" key or "Red" key. With the "Blue" key one can
open the setup menu for the corresponding plugin. The "Green" key
shows the 'man' page of a plugin, if availabe (see below).

To exclude a plugin from the list (for example because it's already
listed in the main menu) one can give a
commandline argument '-x' when starting vdr:

...
-'Plauncher -x plugin1 -x plugin2'
...

This excludes plugin1 and plugin2 from the list. 

To use the 'man' pages put a file pluginname.info (e.g. dvd.info) 
in your VDR config directory, usually the directory 'plugins' in 
your video dir. This file should be a simple ASCII file, describing 
the usage of a plugin.

Build the plugin as usual:

1. Extract in to your PLUGIN/src directory.
2. Make a link to the directory
3. Compile the plugins

Known Bugs:
- the games plugin uses the same mechanism to call its
'subplugins' as this plugin. This leads to a problem when starting 
this plugin from within this launcher plugin. One has to start it twice :-(
