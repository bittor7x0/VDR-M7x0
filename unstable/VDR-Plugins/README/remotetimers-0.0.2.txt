This is a "plugin" for the Video Disk Recorder (VDR).

Description:
------------
With the remotetimers plugin you can add/edit/remove timers on both,
the local (client) VDR and a remote (server) VDR. You can even move
timers between both VDRs. As it's not much fun to add timers without
EPG, the plugin also comes with its own schedule menu.

Requirements:
-------------
- plugin svdrpservice (available via http://vdr.schmirler.de)

Installation:
-------------
Straightforward:
- cd VDR/PLUGINS/src
- tar xzf vdr-remotetimers-<VERSION>.tgz
- ln -sf remotetimers-<VERSION> remotetimers

If you didn't do that already (otherwise svdrpservice.h is missing):
- tar xzf vdr-svdrpservice-<VERSION>.tgz
- ln -sf svdrpservice-<VERSION> svdrpservice

If you want to replace the VDR mainmenus "Schedule" or "Timers" by
the respective plugin menus, you must apply the MainMenuHooks patch
to VDR before compiling remotetimers. The MainMenuHooks patch is
included in the patches directory of the remottimers sources. See the
patch file for more information and instructions.

Now compile and install remotetimers (and svdrpservice) as usual and add
both plugins to the script starting your VDR (e.g. runvdr). No options
required, so simply append:

  -Premotetimers -Psvdrpservice

Check the svdrphosts.conf (or streamdevhosts.conf) file on the remote
VDR: The IP of the VDR running remotetimers must be listed or otherwise
the connection will be refused.

Configuration:
--------------
Before you can connect you have to configure the IP address of the
remote VDR. So you have to enter the plugin's setup menu first. It
offers the following options:

- Hide mainmenu entry
Should be obvious ;-)

- Replace mainmenu "Schedule"
When enabled, each call to the local VDR Schedule menu will give you
the remotetimers Schedule menu instead. Only available if MainMenuHooks
patch has been applied to VDR before compiling remotetimers.

- Replace mainmenu "Timers"
Dito for Timers menu.

- Server IP
IP address of SVDRP server. Leave empty or enter "0.0.0.0" if you want
to use the default IP configured in the svdrpservice plugin.

- Server port
SVDRP port on server (usually 2001). Enter "0" if you want to use the
default port from svdrpservice.

*** Defaults for new timers ***

- Location
Determines if by default new timers will be created on the local or on
the remote VDR.

- User ID
Select the user ID new timers should get by default. Use the special
value "0" to indicate a timer which is always visible, i.e. belongs to
everyone.

*** Settings for "Timers" menu ***

- Filter for user ID
If set to "0", all timers will be shown. Otherwise only those timers are
visible which belong to the same user ID or to everyone (user ID "0").

Usage:
------
The remotetimers menus are more or less a copy of the original VDR
menus. So it should be quite clear how things work. Here are the
differences:

- Edit timers menu (the one where you can change day, time, ...)
The menu has two additional menu items: The location of the timer (local
or remote) and a user ID field.

The purpose of the location field should be obvious. When editing an
existing timer, you can use it to move a timer from the local to the
remote VDR or vice versa. Note that you cannot move a running timer.
It has to be stopped first.

If you have a lot of timers, you can use the user ID to keep things
clearer. The plugin's timers list can filter by user ID. A timer with
ID 0 is always visible. Use other IDs if you want to filter by e.g.
user, client machine or maybe even genre.

- Timers menu (list of all timers)
Looks almost like VDR's original timers menu. A letter in front of the
channel number indicates if this entry refers to a local or a remote
timer. Hit the number keys to change the current user ID filter. With
"0" all timers will be listed. Otherwise the menu title will show you
which user ID filter currently applies.

- Schedule menus
Work and look exactly like the originals. Of course remote timer matches
are flagged, too. Note that there's no user ID filter in the schedule
menus. You will always see all timer matches.

of the menu code I copied from VDR.
