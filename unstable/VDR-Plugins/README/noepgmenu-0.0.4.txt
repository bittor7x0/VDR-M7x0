Description: A simple OSD to manage the channels for the noEPG
patch. Press 'ok' on each channel to toggle between 'noEPG' and
'EPG'. 

This plugin should give a temporary solution to the problem, that the
keys '2', '5' an '8' are reserved for channel selection in the
channels menu since vdr-1.3.38. So the previous function of the patch
cannot be applied here.

I have added a modified patches against vdr that only adds the
noepg functionality to VDR without the menu changes in the channels
menu.
Note: If you already have applied the liemikuutio patch then please use the correspondig noepg patch for this.

Have fun

Christian
