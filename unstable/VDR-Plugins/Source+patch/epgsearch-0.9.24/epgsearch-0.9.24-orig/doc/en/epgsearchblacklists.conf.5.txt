NAME
       epgsearchblacklists.conf - Blacklist

DESCRIPTION
       You can create blacklists in epgsearch and use them in searchtimers.

       A blacklist entry is like a normal searchtimer which is saved in the
       file epgsearchblacklists.conf.

       While editing an searchtimer you can select one ore more blacklist
       entries.

       USAGE

       Searchtimer "Action" use blacklist "Damme".

       Blacklist entry "Damme" searches "Damme"

       First the searchtimer searches all films with "Action".

       Then for each search result epgsearch will test if the result matches
       against "Damme". If so, the result will be dismissed.

SYNTAX
       This file uses the same syntax as epgsearch.conf except that theres no
       <use as searchtimer> field.  So there’s a shift by one field from this
       position. Because that, see "epgsearch.conf(5)".
