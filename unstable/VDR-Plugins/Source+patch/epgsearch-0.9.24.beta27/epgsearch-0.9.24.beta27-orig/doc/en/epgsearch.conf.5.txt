NAME
       epgsearch.conf - The searchtimers

DESCRIPTION
       This file contains the searchtimers.

       Do not edit it manually, you should use SVDRP.

SYNTAX
       Due to some new features there was a change in the format. The format
       is now signed with a comment in the first line. The field delimiter is
       ’:’:

         1 - unique search timer id
         2 - the search term
         3 - use time? 0/1
         4 - start time in HHMM
         5 - stop time in HHMM
         6 - use channel? 0 = no,  1 = Interval, 2 = Channel group, 3 = FTA only
         7 - if 'use channel' = 1 then channel id[|channel id] in VDR format,
             one entry or min/max entry separated with |, if 'use channel' = 2
             then the channel group name
         8 - match case? 0/1
         9 - search mode:
             0 - the whole term must appear as substring
             1 - all single terms (delimiters are blank,',', ';', '|' or '~')
                 must exist as substrings.
             2 - at least one term (delimiters are blank, ',', ';', '|' or '~')
                 must exist as substring.
             3 - matches exactly
             4 - regular expression
        10 - use title? 0/1
        11 - use subtitle? 0/1
        12 - use description? 0/1
        13 - use duration? 0/1
        14 - min duration in minutes
        15 - max duration in minutes
        16 - use as search timer? 0/1
        17 - use day of week? 0/1
        18 - day of week (0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday...;
             -1 Sunday, -2 Monday, -4 Tuesday, ...; -7 Sun, Mon, Tue)
        19 - use series recording? 0/1
        20 - directory for recording
        21 - priority of recording
        22 - lifetime of recording
        23 - time margin for start in minutes
        24 - time margin for stop in minutes
        25 - use VPS? 0/1
        26 - action:
             0 = create a timer
             1 = announce only via OSD (no timer)
             2 = switch only (no timer)
        27 - use extended EPG info? 0/1
        28 - extended EPG info values. This entry has the following format
             (delimiter is '|' for each category, '#' separates id and value):
             1 - the id of the extended EPG info category as specified in
                 epgsearchcats.conf
             2 - the value of the extended EPG info category
                 (a ':' will be translated to "!^colon^!", e.g. in "16:9")
        29 - avoid repeats? 0/1
        30 - allowed repeats
        31 - compare title when testing for a repeat? 0/1
        32 - compare subtitle when testing for a repeat? 0/1
        33 - compare description when testing for a repeat? 0/1
        34 - compare extended EPG info when testing for a repeat?
             This entry is a bit field of the category IDs.
        35 - accepts repeats only within x days
        36 - delete a recording automatically after x days
        37 - but keep this number of recordings anyway
        38 - minutes before switch (if action = 2)
        39 - pause if x recordings already exist
        40 - blacklist usage mode (0 none, 1 selection, 2 all)
        41 - selected blacklist IDs separated with '|'
        42 - fuzzy tolerance value for fuzzy searching
        43 - use this search in favorites menu (0 no, 1 yes)
        44 - id of a menu search template
        45 - auto deletion mode (0 don't delete search timer, 1 delete after given
             count of recordings, 2 delete after given days after first recording)
        46 - count of recordings after which to delete the search timer
        47 - count of days after the first recording after which to delete the search
             timer
        48 - first day where the search timer is active (see parameter 16)
        49 - last day where the search timer is active (see parameter 16)
        50 - ignore missing EPG categories? 0/1
        51 - unmute sound if off when used as switch timer

       A ’:’ in the search term or the directory entry will be translated in a
       ’|’. If a ’|’ exists in the search term, e.g. when using regular
       expressions, it will be translated to "!^pipe^!" (I know it’s ugly ;-))

       There’s no need to fill all fields, only the first 11 fields must
       exist.
