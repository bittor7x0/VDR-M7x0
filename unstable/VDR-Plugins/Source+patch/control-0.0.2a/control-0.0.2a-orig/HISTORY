VDR Plugin 'control' Revision History
--------------------------------------

2004-06-20: Version 0.0.2

- Implemented the telnet protocol to support all kinds of
  clients ;-)
- All OSD elements are rearranged if the client window
  size changes (doesn't work with the MS Windows Telnet
  because this client doesn't send window size changes).
- Fixed a bug in displaying MenuText that shows infos like
  recording summary or the result of a command.
- Using now all tabulators to position the text correctly
  on the client side.
- Texts are shortened if they are too long for the client
  size.
