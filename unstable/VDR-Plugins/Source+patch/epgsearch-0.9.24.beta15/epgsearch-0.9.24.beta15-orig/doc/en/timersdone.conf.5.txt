NAME
       timersdone.conf - list of current timers created by search timers

DESCRIPTION
       This file contains the current timers that were created by search
       timers. If the setup option ’Recreate timers after deletion’ is set to
       ’no’, epgsearch uses this list to determine if a timer was already cre‐
       ated and cancels further timer creations. If a corresponding recording
       was made for any timer in this list, the timer is automatically removed
       from it.

FORMAT
       Timers are stored one per line, where the fields are separated with
       ’:’.

       The following fields exists:

         1 - channel-ID
         2 - start time
         3 - stop time
         4 - search timer ID
         5 - event title
         6 - event episode
