Description:

* Call notification

The Fritz!Box Plugin connects to the Fritz!Box to inform you about
incoming calls. As an option, the plugin can automatically mute
VDR when a call comes in.

To enable this feature you have to dial "#96*5*" with a telephone
connected to the Fritz!Box. This works for all firmware versions 
>= xx.03.99

You may experience problems when trying to dial "#96*5*" with an ISDN 
telephone. In such a case try to activate "auto keypad", "dial * and #" 
or some similar setting in your ISDN telephone. If your ISDN telephone 
contains no keypad support simply use an analogue telephone instead.

If you do not want to be notified by every call, you can specify a list of
MSNs you are interested on in the plugin's setup. Max. 22 monitored MSNs 
are supported.

* Phone book support

The plugin supports multiple phonebooks. In the plugin's setup, you can 
choose which phonebooks are used. The order matters with respect to number
lookup. When a call comes in, the plugin tries to resolve the number using 
the first configured phonebook. If that fails, it tries the second one, and 
so on. 

Only one phonebook can be shown in the plugin's main menu. It is the
first configured phonebook, that has displayable entries. Via VDR's main 
menu you can browse this phone book and initiate calls out of it via the 
[OK]-button. This function uses the telephone you have configures in 
Fritz!Box web interface for this purpose. (In German the menu path is: 
Telefonie > Anrufliste > Wählhilfe) 

-> Fritz!Box phone book

This accesses the Fritz!Box phonebook stored on the box itself.

-> das-oertliche.de phone book

This tries to resolve any number via the german website das-oertliche.de.
As this is a lookup-only phonebook, it's entries cannot be displayed 
in the main menu... ;-)

* Fritz!Box call list

Via the colour buttons you can access three different call lists.
Press [Green] to see the history of incoming calls. Use [Yellow] for the
list of missed calls. Finally [Blue] gives you an overview on whom you 
called yourself.

Pressing [OK] shows a separate page with details to the selected call.
In this menu you can initiate calls, as in the phone book menu, by pressing
[Red].
