Description:

Originally the plugins provided a history of the latest viewed channels.
Since version 0.0.3 statistics (zaps and watchtime) are collected for
each channel.
History can be sorted by latest viewed, zap count and watch time. The idea
is a self-learning favourites list.
The history provides a channel name + EPG view and a channel name + statistics
view.
Statistics and history entries can be deleted or reseted from the menu.
