NAME
       noannounce.conf - list of events that have been marked to not be
       announced via OSD

DESCRIPTION
       This file contains a list of events that have been marked to not be
       announced via OSD by the search timer background thread.

       If the user presses one of the keys ’Ok’, ’0’, ... ’9’ while the
       announcement of an event is displayed, he will be asked if further
       announcements of this event should be disabled for ever (user hit ’0’
       or ’Ok’) or for the next ’x’ days (user hit ’1’ to ’9’). After pressing
       ’Ok’ again, this setting will be stored.

FORMAT
       Events are stored one per line, where the fields are separated with
       ’:’.

       The following fields exists:

         1 - title
         2 - short text
         3 - channel ID
         4 - start time
