This plugins provides addition information about radio channels 
through the OSD. It is designed with north american providers in
mind but will probably work for others as well.

The plugin will automatically launch when a radio channel is detected.


Notes
-----
- If you often see "No Info" try incresing "Max. retries for info"
  in the plugin's setup menu

- If you only see "No Info" try turning off "Use quick PID detection"

- As of version 0.1.0 the names of the configuration variables have changed
  please update your settings
