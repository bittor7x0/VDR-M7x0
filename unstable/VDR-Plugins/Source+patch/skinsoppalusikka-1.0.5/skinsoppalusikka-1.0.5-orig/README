Requirements:

VDR and a spoon for the soup.

Description:

The "Soppalusikka" is a standalone skin providing the good old "ElchiAIO" looks.

Installation:

cd /put/your/path/here/VDR/PLUGINS/src
tar -xzf /put/your/path/here/vdr-skinsoppalusikka-X.Y.Z.tgz
ln -s skinsoppalusikka-X.Y.Z skinsoppalusikka
mkdir -p /path/to/vdrconf/plugins/skinsoppalusikka
cp -d /path/to/channel/logos/*.xpm /path/to/vdrconf/plugins/skinsoppalusikka/
cp -d skinsoppalusikka/themes/*.theme /path/to/vdrconf/themes/
cd /put/your/path/here/VDR
make
make plugins
./vdr -P skinsoppalusikka

Configuration:

Channel logo directory can be given via a command line option (-l) and
it defaults to "skinsoppalusikka" subdirectory in VDR's configuration
directory for plugins.

Notes:

- Only XPM format is supported for channel logos: 64x48 pixels and
  13 colors (6 colors on DXR3) or less recommended.

- If you'll add new channels logos on the fly, remember to flush the
  channel logo cache.

- The channel logos can be named according to channel name (YLETV2.xpm)
  or channel id (T-8438-4097-33.xpm). There's a setup option to select
  the naming scheme.

- There have been bug reports from some DXR3 users about vanishing
  colors and flickering. However, the skin is also reported to work
  without any problems on many DXR3 setups.
