What is VDR-NG-EM ?
-------------------
VDR-NG-EM is a Open Source firmware (except drivers) for Siemens Gigaset M740AV
and M750T EPG, based in VDR-NG from open7x0.org with nice new features.
Also is available a RootFS version for Lemmi firm with VDR binary and plugins.

His full name is: Video Disk Recorder - Next Generation - Edición Mejorada
Initially it was just a version translated to spanish called VDR-NG-ES and later
were added some improvements and changed to VDR-NG-EM "Edición Mejorada" (in
english "Enhanced Edition").


Main new features in firmware
-----------------------------
* Speed up boot and shutdown.
* USB hard disks to 2 times faster.
* All binaries are stripped with sstrip tool (files smaller).
* Removed all symbols and sections not needed in modules (tainted modules from
  DiscVision are 20% smaller).
* Kernel smaller and faster, with real time scheduler, low latency, network
  hashes shrinked, NFS and CRC32 (JFFS2 is very fast with it) backports from 2.6
  and many fixes and speed ups.
* vsftpd as FTP server.
* Hard disks spindown.
* Swap partitions support.
* New webif.
* NTP client.
* SAMBA.
* Recover time from file on powerfail.
* usbautomounter with SVDRP support, interval check on umount and new paremeters.

You can change .config in Linux for add:
* Bash shell.
* BitTorrent client.
* SquashFS with LZMA compression.
* VPN.
* Other programs as dvbsnoop, htop, ...


Main new features in VDR
------------------------
* Backports from VDR 1.7.12.
* Speed ups from VDR-Extensions-Patch-72 for VDR 1.7.7.
* WarEagle icons for REC, timers, TV and radio channels, ...
* Rename recordings, move to other directory, change priority and lifetime,
  show estimated bitrate, ... only with press button number 8 about recording.
* Sort recordings (button number 0) in recordings menu.
* TimeShift.
* commands.conf (at moment only in spanish).
* Rescue menu x4 unplug from commands.conf.
* Plugins can to replace the VDR mainmenus "Schedule", "Channels", "Timers" and
  "Recordings" by a different implementation.
* Player with x9 speeds.
* Replaymode display with symbols (instead of characters) in Skin Classic.
* Shows info, if it is possible to record an event in the timer menu of VDR.
  The first column in the timer-list shows:
     ( + ) recording will be most probably possible (enough space)
     (+/-) recording may be possible
     ( - ) recording will most probably fail (to less space)
  The calculations also consider repeating timers.
* New plugins and updated.

Firmware builder for Linux
--------------------------
svn checkout -q http://svn.assembla.com/svn/VDR-M7x0/unstable ./VDR-NG-EM
cd ./VDR-NG-EM
./make-fw
cd VDR-NG-FW
make

Our original target were spanish users and many things are hardcoded in scripts
and source code.
Due to the interest of some german and french users we are gradually
internationalizing the firmware, but there is still work to do.

If you want to compile our firmware in German (de), French (fr) or English (en),
Rainer Piechura has made a little script to do this work easier.

Run this command after of "./make-fw":
./make-lang de|fr|en

If you have any problems or doubts you can send it to international forum:
